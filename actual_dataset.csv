A32WT1ZEE4QGZB,048645195X,Bella-Bella (By the sea ~~~),"[2, 2]","Working with Mandala type coloring books can teach us a lot. 1) the light/dark placement of colors to bring into focus the center of the mandala (an example is on the cover of the book). 2) learning color choices that work together, teaching us the basics of the standard color wheel. 3) to stay concentrated to a task is good for improving or retaining cognitive capacities. 4) becomes a relaxing process, 5) last and certainly not least, to have some good fun. All of these points will improve our sense of well being.I like this particular Mandala coloring book by Marty Noble because it is a bit more complicated that her other mandala coloring books.  These are very traditional type designs that exhibit ancient sacred designs that span across several spiritual traditions.  They are easily removed from the book to work one at a time.  Four Star:  The designs are on each page, front and back.  This means you cannot use alcohol markers or markers that will bleed through the paper and ruin the other side.  Use high quality coloring pencils for best results.Creative Suggestion: Is to put your favorite design on an overhead projector, shine it on a chosen spot on a blank canvas and trace it. Then fill in with acrylics or oils or even water colors. Or you could complete this same process and project on a wall. This is sure to make an inspirational, yet soothing statement to your surroundings.",4,"Creative, soothing and inspirational spiritual mandalas to enjoy",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",Toys_and_Games

I call it sharing.I ordered several of these - different designs - but all by Dover and Marty Noble.  Of all of them, this is my favorite DESIGN  - but least favorite layout.  It doesn't take up the entire page like the rest of the books do. The design is in the center, and there is quite a bit of white, blank page, left all around it on every side.  What you see on the cover, is probably the biggest design in all of the book.  I will try to get a picture of the inside in the next few days, and post it here for you to see.Despite that, I do love the design.  (Just wish it were bigger, taking up more of the page.)  I love coloring.  It doesn't matter to me what it is, I just like to color.  I love that I have small children still (9 and 2) that I can color with, without looking completely silly (Not that I'd really care).  Coloring is relaxing.I stumbled across this book when I was looking for art supplies, and coloring books for my 17-year-old. (I typed in 'coloring book for teens' on a whim).  And I was happy to find these designs by Marty Noble.  The price was reasonable, and the quality is nice.  It's not a thick (lots of pages) coloring book like you would find for small children, only around 40 pages, I think.  But the pages aren't thin like a child's coloring book either.  They are a little thicker.  A little better quality.  Nice bold white sheets.  I'm thinking you may be able to use markers on this without them bleeding through, but I don't know for sure yet.

However, this product could have been a bit better if they had been printed on one sided paper. (or even paper that was a bit thicker) It is impossible to use paints or markers on these pages, and crayons would be entirely too wide to use effectively due to the very small spaces on a good deal of the designs.. I don't mind using colored pencils, so I'm not completely disappointed, but the ability to use markers without serious bleed-through would have made this product worth five stars.

(The only watch out is that some of the animals I could not think what noises they make!) It is fun for us to go through the ring together or they are easy enough for him to manipulate that he can entertain himself by using them on his own. Given his age, a lot of things still end up in his mouth, including these cards. They have held up very well and aren't completely destroyed! The designs are very cute and this is something that I can see us getting a lot of use out of for the next year or two.  I liked them so much, I ordered another ring for an upcoming trip---they seem like a great plane ride activity.Also, I would highly recommend getting theSecure-A-Toy, BLACK-WHITEto go with this. I used this to strap the rings to the carseat and the stroller, so he can thumb through the cards on his own, but not lose them if he decides to throw them.

The quality of the printing on the animals (which are very cute - just not ) just isn't as crisp the photos online suggest -- which detracts slightly from the overall great quality and cute artistry. I wish the colors were a little brighter, but I guess the softness gives the animals a gentleness that they might not otherwise have.  I love how there are different versions of the animals.  As another reviewer said, many have a mom, dad, and baby to match up with.  My 2.5 year old likes it when I pick out a baby and make him ""talk"" and say ""where is my mommy/(daddy)?"" and then she searches for the mom (or dad).  She likes to make the animals ""ride"" on the tractor and feed them the apples or hay.  When we put them away, I pretend like the top of the box is a hungry mouth and she loves throwing the magnets into the mouth (kinda goofy, but at least it gets her to help a little...I guess).  They seem to stick pretty well and I haven't had any peeling issues.  If it ever goes for ten bucks, I would grab it.

Another thing I like about this is the back of the puzzle is a white surface so after they've done this puzzle for a while and maybe are getting bored with it you can put together white side up and then draw together on it and then let the child put that puzzle that they made together just an idea but deftly could be fun for the whole family. You could even draw a map to their birthday or Christmas presents on the puzzle pieces that have them find the puzzle pieces to build the map find where their presence are located (that which is me brainstorming out but that would be fun also)Here's a few things that you can do to introduce the puzzle and get more out of it. I think putting it together 1st so the child gets the picture and then start disassembling it a piece of the time will help engage even young children and helping them to get the concepts of puzzles. another thing you could do is put the puzzle together upside down have them flip each piece over and then start putting each piece they flip over together again another little way to help them get engaged and understand the concepts of puzzles.To me I personally feel that helping children understand puzzles and how to put pieces together is one of the best early learning tools you can offer them.,5,Very high quality puzzle - I think puzzels are great for kids.,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",Toys_and_Games

Puzzles are great for motor skills and problem solving, especially for young minds.My 2 1/2 year old niece loves puzzles, so Mudpuppy at the Zoo was an instant hit.  She is drawn to the cute animals and bright colors.  She still has trouble picking out how the picture goes together, but the shape of the puzzle pieces helps her to solve it.  She needs some help with the puzzle, so a 2 year age recommendation may not work in all cases.  But she learns teamwork and problem-solving skills.The pieces are a little thicker than traditional pieces, easier for smaller hands to grip and piece together.  Although it is still cardboard, the extra thickness makes it more durable.  The construction of the pieces is great and should last repeated puzzling, even with a toddler.  I would caution putting the puzzle together on softer surfaces like carpet or padded tables, the pieces are more likely to bend faster.  I especially like that it is made from recycled paper and nontoxic soy-based inks.I recommend this puzzle and this company to toddlers, or those who would supply them with puzzles.

Since birds are a natural source of food for cats (feral) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol. two. Contrary to all the cartoons, cats are not fishermen, and thus, fish, either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to. Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live, they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell.

I have two dogs and the second one started this habit and taught it to our first dog.  So disgusting!  As suggested by others we doubled the dosage and so far (about six months plus) it's been working I would say about 90% of the time (that we can tell).My husband and I work long hours so they are in our side yard (about 15 x 45) for many hours by themselves with a door to the garage.  Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work, before using this product, it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles.  We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again (and pick up any piles) to alleviate this problem.  However, we still ecountered this problem rather frequently.  The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we didn't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product, we believe that the habit has stopped, if not all the way, at least to a significant degree.  Other than I think twice in the last six months, we now come home to dogs that don't gross us out with their bad breath anymore.  And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing:  Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food.  I don't know if this powder was to blame or if it's a supplement that we also give to him.  But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles.  Just adding a bit of those to the top of his dry dog food really helps with his finishing his food.

She'd been living in multi-dog households (meaning four dogs or more) for her entire life. We just have one other dog, her brother. She immediately began ingesting feces from both her and her brother. I'm not sure if this is a habit from living with many other dogs or was brought on by the stress of being in a new home, but I was determined to stop it.We tried a product from Drs. Foster and Smith called Distaste and it worked quite well, but my male dog wasn't terribly thrilled with it-- it came in chew form and he didn't seem to like them. So I found this SEP and was glad to see it's something mixed into their food. It does not work as well as the Distaste, but seems to discourage her. All winter I have noticed my female picking up frozen specimens and marching around the yard with them... but she doesn't seem to be eating them. I plan to double the dose, as some other reviewers have noted, and we'll see how things go through the spring. We are typically quick about cleaning up after them, particularly now that we can see the ground, but occasionally we miss a pile. I'm hoping that the problems we had this winter with the SEP not working well were maybe because the feces were frozen, and now that things are thawing, maybe the SEP will discourage her more strongly.So bottom line, it seems to be working fairly well, but has not broken the habit completely. My only other comment is the smell of the product itself. It smells like Pixie Stick dust, or something similarly sweet/sour and I find the smell really awful.

I bought it at Lowe's for about the same price on Amazon a few weeks ago.  A couple problems: the hook at the top slides around the short section of wire on the cage that it hooks on (maybe an inch total).  Just means that it doesn't sit perfectly level.  The problem with that is that the birds don't like sitting on the downward-sloping part, so they only use the upward sloping part.  I'm going to try modding it so the hook isn't detachable and doesn't slide, but just stays in the middle so it's level.  The other issue is that the birds don't like sitting on the front/back of the suet cage, I think because it moves around a lot when they land, but every time they try it, there's a lot of wing flapping for a few seconds before they give up and use the other feeder.  This might get better with time.  If it does, I will update this review.  For now, I would say it's so-so for a suet feeder.  I've been looking at nicer more expensive ones, but I'll give this another month (and update this review!)UPDATE: The feeder made it through the season, but I don't think I'd buy again.  Not even sure if I'll put it out next year.  I have another feeder that has space for suet on each side.  That suet gets eaten REALLY quickly, while the one in the cage lasts long enough to start molding (several weeks).

I had used EverClean for years and really had no complaints.  Last year our cat, Poloma, started to urinate more frequently and my back was starting to hurt when I bent down to clean the clumps.I had seen the LitterMaid litter box advertised for several years and had always wondered if it could really be true and work as it was advertised.  Sorry, I finally gave in and purchased along with the tent top.The tent top came with several pieces missing/broken.  I called the company who asked me to fax the part numbers so they could forward them to me.  They sent me the wrong parts and I have not been able to get around to ask for them again.  I will though.The machine seems to work to not on the clumps of urine.  I have to now clean the clumps out DAILY rather than every few days.  The machine tries but is too weak to push,lift and dump.  INstead I walk into the room only to see the red blinking light which indicates a jam.I called the company and explained my problem.  The only advice they could give me was to be sure and use a quality clumping litter.  I would have though the high price I pay for Litter Green would have been considered quality clumping litter.

You do have to break them down a few times a year for a good cleaning and keep the track the rake rides in halfway clean, but otherwise still the best thing. I will never be without them or without a spare in the closet just in case!One suggestion is that the manufacturer scale back the side panels of the receptacle lid so that these can function in a smaller space when the rake hit it, such as in a  closet without hitting the doors.  I have 4 of these units in a closet, two on the floor and two on a shelf a little higher and have them side by side.  I broke one when the lid sides pushed against the back inside of the closet door when raking to the receptacle because someone had shut the closet dorr partially.

A35DJ5UIZVGBP6,B00005MF9T,gshoes,"[1, 1]","The Good Stuff: My cats love this litter box. When I'm cleaning it they pace around me like a child waiting for their teddy bear to come out of the wash. When I had one cat the bin needed to be emptied once a week. Now with 2 it's more like every 3 days. I line the bin with a little trash bag and it works great. No need to buy the expensive receptacles. Every so often I'll have to use the special litter scoop that comes with it to scrape some ""left over"" off the rake. It does make a noise but it's not that loud. I recommend leaving it in a closet or laundry room. Guests always ask why my boiler room is making noise. The noise doesn't bother my cats, they actually come running to watch it work. It is, however, the only litter box they've ever known.The Catch: I bought the box in April and had no problems until late October when I realized the box was getting very full. The censors had stopped working. I called their customer service, who's pre-recorded message makes you think you've called the wrong number (they start talking about tools), and spoke with some friendly but not 100% knowledgeable people. They gave me all kinds of instructions on how to fix it myself like dusting off the censors, ""re-setting"" the box by clicking the switches 10 times each, etc. All of these things I tried as they are in the instructions but I humored them. Finally they gave me instructions on how to get a new box so now I'm in the process of mailing the wire that powers the rake, the battery compartment cover, my receipt, and $10 so I can get a new one. I'm not too happy that I had to destroy my box with no guarantee they will send me a new one but I understand why they make you do it.The Moral of the Story: Nothing makes a cat happier than a clean littler box and now that it's broken I simply can't keep it clean enough for them (in their opinions). I'm going to get the replacement and use it until it breaks too but I think I'm going to look into the toilet training kit.",3,Love - Hate relationship,1164067200,"11 21, 2006",Pet Supplies
A1QCJOGQL05KRI,B00005MF9T,Jaw,"[2, 2]","I gave 5 stars because i've had three Litter Maids over about 12-13 years and have always been very grateful not to have to clean the catbox--i was able to forget about it for at least a couple of weeks at a time, sometimes much more. I have only one small cat.  You can't beat not having to think about the catbox, it's almost like not having one at all--compared to the old fashion litter box.I first saw the Litter Maid in the LA Times Magazine around 1995, there was a full page ad, and you could pay in three installments, it was expensive, at least a couple hundred.  Catbox scooping depressed me so i ordered one.  Mine worked right out of the box.it's always tricky putting the right amount of litter in.  If i put too much, it just keeps recycling and raking until i take some out.  Following the instructions, i found that there would be too much litter and the machine would malfunction, but if i put it lower than the limit line, it would be fine.I had some kind of technical problem in the beginning, i can't remember what, and was pleased with their tech support, they took care of me, way back then.After a few years, it stopped working and i gladly got another one.  At some point, i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out.  That was yet another technical advance for my situation.  The Litter Pearls absorbed the urine so there was less stuff getting scooped into the box, and i was able to go even longer without being reminded of the litter box.In the beginning, Litter Pearls was just regular little round pearls. Then, my pet store came out with ""lite tracking litter pearls"" which were not round. They made them irregular shaped and rough, to prevent tracking i guess. That new light tracking style did not agree with my Litter Maid.  It was too granular and it jammed up the mechanism.  My pet store stopped carrying the regular non-lite tracking kind of Litter Pearls, so i had to search for an alternative.The combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life.  I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter. I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state, (i called around) if necessary, or on eBay, but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store, the brand is Litter Secret, i couldn't find the product on the web though.As long as i had the little round ball litter, not the lite tracking kind, my Litter Maid performed consistently.  The second one lasted several more years with never a mechanical problem.  Long ago, i got the tent. I would always use a tent with the Litter Maid.  For me, the less evidence of a litter box the better.The Litter Maid rake did not clean easily and with my policy of not paying a lot of attention to the litter box, eventually the second Litter Maid got messy and the price had come way down on them, so i decided rather than clean it, i'd just get a new one.  the motor was still working fine, there was no problem with it after several years. I just didn't feel like cleaning it, was working lots of overtime and my job and felt i could afford a new one. I've had the third one for several more years, it has been very low maintenance, no mechanical problems, i just have cleaned it every few weeks, i'm not sure how often, maybe 2 weeks, maybe more, it seems long between times when i have to deal with it.Recently it stopped working.  The light was on but without warning, it wouldn't become active, it just sat there.I got a Litter Robot to replace it, because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change, since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days.  I'm still evaluating the Litter Robot, but there are some things that so far, i like better about the Litter Maid, one is, i didnt' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid, just take out the plastic containers, and then do a big cleaning once in a great while.  I think i'm going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.The Litter Maid plastic containers were easier for me to switch out and replace than the plastic bags for the Litter Robot, less struggle, less time spent bending over the ""dreaded area.""  And more secure feeling because stiff plastic is thicker than a plastic bag.Being inside the tent, the LItter Maid didn't have anything directly exposed to open air, whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world.  Having said all of that, the LItter Robot is very cool.  More ingenious than the LItter Maid.  anyone could dream up the LItter Maid.  It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot.  Watching it do its thing is something to behold, in terms of human engineering.  I was very happy with the LItter Maid, my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years.  I didn't have to deal with tech support.  But again, i had only one small cat.Oh, i almost forgot. My cat always liked to use only one side of the Litter Maid, so the waste would pile up on one end of the plastic container, causing it to fill up faster, only on that side, than it would if it had been distributed evenly.  When it fills up and doesn't close completely, that's when i can smell it and i go into action to change the container, but i alway would find that half the container wasn't used, it was empty on one side, full on the other. This never affected the mechanical performance of the Litter Maid itself.Update:  10/3/10I have just retired my most recent Litter Maid which i started using a year ago.  I was having a very hard time with it.  It worked well as far as the motor and everything it's supposed to do, but the problem  was with the litter (crystals). The crystals were getting saturated in only about 4 days and if i didn't change the litter, my cat would pee on the floor cover that i kept under the litter maid.  That is way too frequent to have to deal with cat sewage, by my standards.  Urine was getting all over the box and under the box. I thought the litter maid was leaking but couldn't find any openings.  It took me a long time to figure out that my cat's hyperthyroid condition was causing her to excessively urinate.  When i realized it, about two months ago, i doubled her medication and the problem has gone away. but she continued to refuse to use the Litter Maid, i think it must've developed an odor because of all the urine all over it, i tried to wipe it off but far from perfectly i'm sure.  Even though the crystals weren't saturated at all, she was peeing on the floor cover.  So i have just replaced the Litter Maid with a ScoopFree automatic box. So far it's working great. I took the Litter Maid outside, cleaned it as best i could with diluted Simple Green spray, it looks ok, i put it some big plastic bags and will keep it in the garage.  It has been working very well.  A real trooper.I want to say that i appreciate the Litter Maid, it served me well for about 16 or more years, about 5 of them over those years, two were thrown out not because they wore out but because they were dirty so in my experience they have worked well. I never had a problem with the motors, and i was always impressed at the way it just kept raking over and over, never giving out.This is different from some peoples' experience.  I want say that i have always used Litter Pearls crystals in the litter Maid, not clay or clumping litter, and that may be why i haven't had the same problems some have had.  I would recommend using crystal litter with it, but in my experience, it had to be the rounded kind, not the trackless/lite tracking kind which are irregularly shaped.  The trackless kind were too abrasive and jagged for the litter maid, they jammed it up, causing the rake to come to a painful creaking halt in mid cycle. But the rounded ones work well, they just aren't easy to find because people tend to prefer lite tracking litter.  But other than that, the crystals have always worked great in the Litter Maid.",5,not perfect but i've loved them,1190419200,"09 22, 2007",Pet Supplies

This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried. I'm afraid it wasn't our last, as it had numerous problems.First, the tines would get clumped full of stuff and it would get caked solid rather quickly. I'll note that we didn't even try having this be the ""only"" litter box in our home! We had two others there too. We just wanted to see how well this worked. The storage container would get jammed in the open position, so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.However, we could have dealt with those issues. We could have cleaned the tines daily, and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly. The real problem was far more serious.First, understand how this works. The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area, the tines move across, dragging any solids and clumps with it, pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end. Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth, back and forth, driving the poor kitties to distraction. There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them!We tried several times to fix this, but it really just wasn't worth it. We moved on to other options and found a GREAT one. This one went in the trash as we couldn't even imagine subjecting any other cat owner to it.

I mean cleaning completely, with a new coat of scotch-guard on the pan surface and fresh litter refilled.And that may not make a difference if you have a cat that aims for the plastic tines. And cleaning those is kinda nasty. I've noticed that a new version is out with metal tines.  Maybe the manufacturer's cat had good aim too.Since writing the review below we got a cat with exceptional aim. He could jam up that thing in one session. We were cleaning it every day, and finally opted this year to get a plain old deep rectangular litter pan with scoopable litter and ditch the Litter Maid.  Heck - we were in cleaning it everyday anyway due to our 'artistic' new cat.---------------------------------------I have three cats, all indoor, and you can imagine I've tried about every kind of litter to come up with something workable for both me and the cats.I've had a LitterMate (the larger size) for almost a year now and think this is the next best thing to sliced bread. we liked it so well, we've recently gotten the regular sized one as well since the cats were giving the one we had such a workout.Pros:Our dogs no longer go litter-diving for 'snacks'. The mechanism scares them and most of the contents are now hidden away in the plastic container.The cats are only fascinated by the workings of the litterbox and had no problem adjusting. The oldest was 6, the youngest 5 months.Scoopable litter + three cats previously meant 2-3 times a day  scooping the litterbox. One LitterMate + three cats = 2-3 times a week tray dumping.  The trays are easily reused, making them more economical.The box itself has been dumped and cleaned every other month. The comb is held in place by two screws and is easily removed from the engine to be cleaned. I soak the bottom pan and comb in an antibacterial  cleaner solution, and after it's dry use Scotchguard on both.The house I live in is small - there are few places to hide litterbox odor. This does it effectively.One of our cats like to dig his way to China when he covers his stuff.  I was worried that the scratches on the bottom of the pan would cause more sticking than normal, but a generous coating of Scotchguard keeps things moving along in spite of the battle scars in the LitterMaid.Cons:Yes - litter does escape underneath a little, but with the activities of three cats we were always vaccuming around the litter box anyway - no difference there.The litter flinging problem happened once to me - every time afterwards I threw the garbage bag on top of the tray while I removed it, then just tipped it into the bag. Again, no biggie.Tips:Those lines in the litterbox aren't kidding - don't fill the box over the red line, or the motor will jam.When they say Premium clumping litter, they mean it.  The alternative is a constantly jammed motor.Whenever you empty the tray, pass the scraper through the pan to make sure that nothing escaped the comb along the bottom. Those spots can build up and cause a jam too.If stuff sticks too often to the comb or bottom, it usually means it's time to dumb the entire box and clean and re-coat it with nonsitck spray. Not the non-stick spray used in cooking either.",4,"I was a skeptic, but it is honestly WORTH IT",1102377600,"12 7, 2004",Pet Supplies
A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7,B00005MF9T,Yoda,"[1, 1]","This thing has a number of problems with it. None really prevents it from performing its function (eventually) but all add up to a real pain. One problem is that the plastic boxes that the cat manure is scooped up into do not fit very well into their canister. As a result cat litter seeps through the gaps and you end up having to vacuum underneath every few days. It should not have been that difficult to make a better fitting plastic box or area where it is to be placed.A second problem is that the red ""fill"" line is misleading. If litter is filled up to that point (or even fairly close to it) the machine jams. As a result, to prevent jamming, one needs to fill the device with far below its full capacity. This, in turn, necessitates filling the machine with more cat litter than should be the case (i.e., twice a week instead of once).A third problem is that the rakes, many times, get jammed due to filling up with litter. The rakes should have been made further apart to reduce this.In short, the machine does do its job but with a few relatively minor modifications (that should have been easy to spot for the manufacturer) this machine could have been much improved._______________________________Update:After less than one year machine breaks down and needs to be replaced.

A2HP4F7A2FKL6G,B00005MF9U,Bett Sundermeyer,"[14, 15]","I bought the largest LitterMaid off of Ebay in Jan 2003 from a Seller called KittenKaboodle. It took a few trials to find a litter that worked well but I settled on Scoop Away. Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, sometimes it does stick to the bottom and you will have to use the scooper to scrape it up or clean the rakes sometimes. Then, I just turn it on and off and it will rake everything up.  It only takes me a few seconds to check for any stuck spots or even out the litter, turn it on and off to make it rake and then add a little new litter to the top (so the cats think it's nice and clean). :-) It's not completely ""no work"" but it is a lot less work than a ""manual"" litterbox and stays smelling cleaner than manual boxes.  I do use larger plastic grocery bags in the receptacle. It's a lot cheaper than throwing away receptacles every 3-4 days and it's alot easier to clean. Believe me, I do not like trying to pry those receptacles out when it is completely full.  You have to stick your fingers inside to grab onto it (YUCK!) and it's heavy and hard to get out sometimes dumping litter and stuff all over the place (double YUCK).The Seller on Ebay was selling the one I bought with a ""super charged"" motor (which is in the electrical cord). It worked pretty good for almost a year. Apparently, unlike the ""normal motor"", the stronger motor kept it from resetting sometimes when it would hit clumps that were too big for it.  It would attempt to plow right thru which sounds like a good thing, but it wasn't. Apparently the gears and/or sprokets which move the rake along are made of plastic and within a year they were stripped. It started out making a spinning sound once in awhile but would eventually go ahead and rake. One day I came home to a god awful sound. I found the rake stuck right in the middle of the box, gears just spinning and making a heck of a racket. This was enough to scare away ALL 4 cats from the ONLY litterbox. Needless to say we had some accidents. 3 of my cats ""recovered"" and would go back to the disconnected box, but my 20 year old cat was traumatized and refused to use it. So I had to set up the manual box. I'm STILL working with her trying to get her to stop going elsewhere because of this.I took the Littermaid to a repair shop and they knew immediately that the gears were stripped because they'd seen it before. They said they couldn't repair it because they couldn't get parts.I contacted the Ebay Seller who said it was still under warranty. I had to pay shipping to and from the Seller though which was not cheap. The 2nd supercharged Littermaid started doing the same thing after less than 6 months and the Seller says this one is not under warranty. Apparently, the warranty does not extend to the replacement that they sent me which I think is a rip-off considering how expensive these things are.While the 1st Littermaid was being repaired, I went ahead and bought another ""regular"" (not supercharged) Littermaid from Petsmart. I've had it 8 months and had no skipping problems so far. I think the ""supercharged"" motor caused all my problems, but KittenKaboodle refuses to acknowledge this and refused to warranty the 2nd box that they sent me.So, overall it's great when it works, but it could use a few improvements. The bottom of the pan needs to be made of something more ""non-stick"" so the rake can get thru some of the larger wet spots and/or the gears need to be made of something stronger to be able to take a stronger motor that can get thru the stuck on clumps (and not strip the gears). Also I would like to see a slightly larger receptacle on the larger models. They are made for a multi cat household but with only one litterbox it fills up pretty fast. With 2 litterboxes it's not too bad though. I would also like to see some sort of hood like other auto litterboxes that I've seen. That tent seems like a nuisance (it looks like it would block the on/off switch and collect litter in the box.)",4,"I LOVED it while it worked, but has a few glitches.....",1091836800,"08 7, 2004",Pet Supplies

Then he kicked the damp litter up behind the rake mechanism and into the tracks the rake uses. The litter would clog the tracks so the rake would get stuck, and the litter behind the rake unit prevented it from returning all the way back. Cleaning it out seemed to only encourage him to do it again!They need to come up with a way to shield the rake and tracks from the litter or at least clean the tracks as it cleans the litter.If your cat(s) go in the middle of the box like they are ""supposed"" to this is a good product, albeit a bit expensive to use.

Since I work all day and the cats are on their own, I can count on these self-cleaning litter boxes to keep the box up to my cats' high standards.My only complaint is LitterMaid's quality control can be a little inconsistent.  Over the years I've had defective units right out of the box a little more often than I'd like.  I don't think it's unique to LitterMaid, I've seen similar QC problems with just about anything made in China.  If LitterMaid has a choice, they really should reconsider where they're doing business.  It's at the point that if I have a choice between products either made in China or elsewhere, I choose the product NOT made in China just because I've been burned too many times by shoddy workmanship, even from supposedly name brand products.",5,"Great product, a godsend for cat owners.",1260835200,"12 15, 2009",Pet Supplies

This stresses the motor out to were it resets itself, thus not scooping anything.  Or if it does break through it, the clump crumbles to small enough pieces where it slips through the scooper and quickly starts to stink.  I tried five different types of litter, nothing improved the machines performance.  I ended up keeping a hand scooper and plastic bags available as I had to scoop and clean it myself.  The plastic mounts on the scooper ended up snapping of after two months of use.  The box is just messy and useless and hard to wash as you have to disassemble it.

That being said I've found a few things are necessary to do to make it work at its best:1) Use Littermaid litter. Is more expensive but I don't have to constantly throw all of it out so I think I break even. It clumps perfectly and I get very few leavings.2) Empty the recepticals when they are half full. This will help avoid the vile spatter and spilling. Alternatively, seal the top down before taking out the bottom section and then pull the whole thing out, empty it and then put the old set back (I definitely reuse them).3) Don't bother with the tent. It's huge, the opening isn't wide enough to fully open the litter cover when you go to empty it and if your cat is as vigorous as mine at covering the litter, it will get in between the box and tent and is hard to clean. I find the height of the littermaid is enough that he doesn't fling litter out the back or sides, just occasionally over the litter recepticle when it's getting too full.",4,Better than everything else I've tried,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",Pet Supplies

They told me that it was under their one year warranty. They asked me to cut the white power cord on the rake and return it to them which I did. Within a week they sent me out a brand new litterbox. I am very pleased. Best Customer Service Ever! A+++++I should tell you that I've had this litter box before..About 6 years ago I had 3 cats and bought one of these litter boxes to save my sanity and my back. At the time that I purchased it, it SUGGESTED (NOT REQUESTED)that you use premium cat litter. At that time I saw it as a marketing ploy to get me to buy premium cat litter so I disregarded their suggestion..Bad mistake... It was clogging at least once a week but at the time I still considered this to be nothing considering the fact that I wasnt having to scoop anymore. I had that unit for about 2 and 1/2 years and then it died on me. I still think I got a good deal out of it though.So recently I bought the same litter box again only this time it REQUIRES  you to use the premium cat litter so I bought the ""scoop away"" cat litter at the supermarket. This litter is supposed to be better than the regular litter because it is more absorbent than the regular and it clumps and drys more quickly than the traditional kitty litter. Since the Littermaid Litter box rakes the litter 10 minutes after the cat leaves, you need a litter that can clump and dry quickly. Well, now I get this! Since I bought the litter box (2 weeks ago) I havent had any clogs and am actually using less Kitty litter than before since it clumps so well.The litterbox is turnkey provided you use the premium kitty litter. I am really glad I bought this product. I am happy...Oh, another point, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE KITTY LITTER LEVEL BELOW THE SUGGESTED LINE. I have learned that the machine works harder (and breaks more frequently) if you put too much kitty litter in it. I keep the litter a little below the line.

My cats have been using the LitterMaid for a couple of weeks now and I have removed the old stinky litterbox from the room.  I had very little difficulty training the cats to use the new box; I just followed the simple instructions that came with the Littermaid.  The only difficulty I had in getting the cats accustomed to the new box was a teenager who thought it hillarious to yell boo at a cat as it watched the box clean itself.  Needless to say, that cat took a little longer getting used to the LitterMaid and the teenager got the privelege of cleaning the old box.Just as it advertises, 10 minutes after use, the &quot;sifter&quot; runs from one end of the box to the other, lifting the clumps and depositting them in the container at the end.  A few times it had a little difficulty with a very large clump and I heard it reverse and try again several times before successfully completing the trip.  I do have a problem with litter being dumped on the floor, either by an energetic cat or the sifter pushing litter in front of a clump and over the edge.Don't start thinking this will reduce how often you have to deal with a litter box.  You still have to empty the container daily, add/rearrange the litter daily and probably vacuum frequently.  It misses the really small clumps so you'll have to sift once in a while.  However, it only takes a minute to do these tasks and it really keeps down the smell.

If you are not willing to do this, it won't help much to get this type litterbox.  My years of previous experience with cats and boxes have proved quite informative so I'll try to give you the low down and insight that hopefully will help.First, multi cat homes need checked daily, not necessarily changed, just checked.  A large cat can't aim the center of the box, especially portly cats.  They being large cats end up hitting the very end of the litter area with urine then the machine sweeps and it then clings a clump stuck to the plastic.  This only happens once in a while when the cat is facing the machine area and his hind end toward the hopper.  Otherwise, the other reason is a not totally clumped chunk of whatever that gets caught in the teeth then rides back to the original position where it dries and then becomes like concrete.  A good brand of litter helps cure some of those problems.Through trial and error, Everclean litter is a great alternative to the brand that littermaid sells ... sold in pet store and amazon.If you have dogs, place the unit with the hopper away from where your dog can pull it out.  My basset hounds would get the notion to dine and pulled the hopper out and it wasn't a pretty site.  I don't have them anymore that was years ago they did that but the memory is still there!Lastly, this LM900 is a bit quieter than the original, battery life is NOT what they say... two months is not ever going to happen.",4,LitterMaid review and suggestions for you,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",Pet Supplies

The vet said that some cats are just extra fastidious and no matter how many times a day a person scoops the box as long as there is anything at all in the box they will refuse to use it.I was hesitant at first to get this, fearing that the cat would be frightened of the motor and would become even more traumatized by the litter box. With great trepidation, I set the LitterMaid up, and from that moment on, there has never been a single instance of the cat straying from the box to do his business.Some people say that a motorized cat box is a waste of money, but it is well worth trying if you face a similar dilemma: it can save your sanity and your carpet, and may let some cats stay in loving homes instead of being abandoned or even euthanized.I am absolutely delighted with the LitterMaid, and have had no problems with it, and at this point mine is over two years old.

I've always found them to be great, but not very long lived.My littermaids have serviced 2 cats at all times.  So, if you are a single cat house, you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these.  The first unit's motor died.  The second, the spring in the power rake's cord broke, and couldn't reel in the cord anymore.  The third (my last) up and died, no warning or otherwise.  Just stopped running.My first Littermaid was the original.  It lasted about 4 years.  The next was the original ""Mega Advance"" and was the best when it was working.  That only lasted about 3-4 years.  The last Mega (not advance) lasted about 5-6 years, but was very noisy.This newer unit seems to be basically the same as the last Mega, but the motor is slightly more quiet and pushes the rake through the box at a faster clip.  Both nice improvements.  The included scoop has tines in it to clean out the rake, a great idea that only took 15 years....I've never run my Littermaids on batteries, always using the A/C plug.  If the power's out for a few hours, we can survive, or if needed, scoop.If there was a way to make the system a bit more quiet it would be perfect.Tips:1.  Don't over-fill the box.  Use the bottom (add litter) line as the top fill line.  If you fill to the top line, the system will not work as well.  This seems to be the #1 problem people have, adding too much litter.2.  Use a bit of cooking oil spray (Pam) on the bottom of the pan before you fill with litter.  I rarely clean ours, but when I do, I always spray the bottom of the pan and that really helps keep the box cleaner and helps keep the nasty stuff from getting stuck to the bottom.3.  Use high-quality clumping litter.  We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco.  That lasts more than a month for us.4.  Re-use the waste containers.  They each should last a month or more. Just keep using them until they crack when you are removing to dump the contents.  Then replace.

I feel very obliged to share my views about this old workhorse, the HP12C GOLD at its 25th anniversary and my 1Oth year as a satisfied ower user and fan. Especially after sharing my frank views on Amazon about two of its three successors on Amazon.com, burying the HP12c Platinum (2004 1st release, HP12cP) and praising the HP12c Platiunum Anniversary Edition (2006 3rd release, HP12cPAE or HP12cPA).To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans, including the non-techkie nerd like myself, the name Hewlett-Packard To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans. The brandname of Hewlett-Packard is synonymous with the highest quality and best range offered in handheld electronic business financial calculators before the first generation of personal computers hits the desktops of business users.To date (December 2007), the bearer of this ""gold"" standard is none other than the HP12C HP's ""golden boy"" in its calculator business segment.The HP12C now a matured product, is the only continuing HP handheld surviving calculator product since '81 and probably the longest selling electronic calculator ever. According to HP almost 15 million HP 12Cs, cPs was sold since ,it is probably the best selling HP (and RPN) calculator ever.As a proven product, the HP12C ""gold"" works from day 1, with its form factor and sofware remaining unchanged and has not been dethroned by rivals and even its HP successors which had come and go.Even with PC software versions being sold, the 12C remains the truly indispensable ""portable"" finance-business heldheld computer for its owners, professionals and students alike. This handy companion powers up immediately and is faster than any portable personal computers to jump right into the action.The HP12C is a serious product and the ultimate time tested solution, field tested proven by its users and survived all its rival products, the workhorse moves on.Anyone in charge of this HP line should always bear in mind that the continued production run of the HP 12c is a testimony of HP's quality and standard expected by its customers.Don't just listen to a HP12C fan here, I own and am using three out of 4 models of the HP 12C series, and it is amusing and somewhat disappointing to observe that it had taken HP at least four years and two major upgrades of the HP 12c Platinium, in its futile attempt to ""fix & retire"" the HP12C with three successors in the form of HP12cPlatinum since 2004.It would seems especially frustrating on the part of HP, to realize after all the effort spent on remaking the HP12cPlatinum models that it would not outdone its siblings the HP10bII and HP17bII+ series to seriously challenge the HP12C Gold.  However, by their own rights the HP10Bs and HP17Bs, and the HP12cPlatinum may find their rightful place in the HP financial calculator line, differentiating the HP12C GOLD in terms of price and functions.IMHO, this had happened because the following golden rules were infringed by HP...GOLDEN RULE I - A PRODUCT WHICH STILL SELLS ITSELF IS NEVER OBSOLETE.GOLDEN RULE II - IF IT AREN'T BROKEN, DON't FIX IT ! ""The gold rule of thumb should always be guarded as gospel by the HP heldheld calculator product team. Based on the same reasoning, the HP12C's built quality and product standard is paramount to its users.GOLDEN RULE III - ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS! If in doubt, see rules I & II.GOLDEN RULE IV - ONLY OUTSOURCE THE MANUFACTURING OF YOUR PRODUCT TO SOMEONE WHO COULD BETTER YOUR OWN PRODUCT QUALITY. If in doubt ask IBM about Lenovo.GOLDEN RULE V - THE BENCHMARKING INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE IS THE HP12C. Just in case, if HP does not know or is not listening to its customers.GOLDEN RULE VI - DO NOT DISCONTINUE THE ICONIC HP12C GOLD. HP needs no reminder that the customer is always right. Please let your customer, the ultimate market force decide if the HP12C should ever be retired.As an ardent fan of HP12C and line of financial business & scientific calculators, I am of the view that the day when HP discontinue the HP12C would be the day it exit this business segment. I speculate this would happen when the HP brandname disappears from the 12C just like after IBM name had disappeared from ThinkPads and ThinkCentres.Since the price of GOLD is on the rise, it is indeed puzzling to fans of the HP12C, why HP did not release a genuine HP12C gold 25th anniversary model for the fans to mark the occasion, if replacing the discontinuing the HP12C GOLD is the intention READ ALL GOLDEN RULES above.To be fair, the silver HP12c Platinum Anniversary is very nice and has spotted the ""retro"" silver look of the HP 11C, however, it is still not the GOLD standard. With HP missing this golden opportunity to mark the occasion, I would love to see and own a HP 12C engraved with 50th Anniversary logo, reckon that this would be the ultimate testimony for the HP12C and a milestone for its fans.Looking forward, a GOLD 50th anniversary HP12C Anniversary model would be very nice for the fans.For HP, this is a lucrative business proposition. By now, they would have realized that if they have any of its products which could hit a 50th year home run  in 2031, it would not be from its other product line-it would be this original HP12C GOLD standard bearer.

A49R5DBXXQDE5,B00000JBLH,R. D Johnson,"[7, 8]","I've started doing more finance stuff recently and went looking for a good time-value-of-money calculator. I was pleasantly surprised to find the HP12C was still available. I've been using HP calculators for decades (HP-45, HP-15 and now an HP-32SII) because of their great feel and long-lasting quality. However, it's also true that the HP12C is probably the last relic of the great HP calculator legacy. It has 'Made In China' stamped on the rear, but the keyboard feel seems much like my dear departed 15C. Hopefully it will have the same long-term durability.Why do I recommend this calculator?*) RPN. In my world, the purpose of a calculator is to solve fairly straightforward math exercises quickly. If you're a college student and need speed and pictures and parenthesis, buy a graphing calculator. If you're solving Black-Scholl's option equations, fire up Excel or something on your desktop computer. But for straightforward punch-it-in calculator work, nothing beats RPN entry.*) Fit and Finish. The keys have good tactile feedback. The display blinks on every entry. You just *know* you've entered the data correctly. The purpose of a calculator is quick, accurate answers at your fingertips. If you don't care about this, don't waste money on this calculator (or any high-end TI or Casio). Buy a $5 Walmart calculator.*) Straightforward financial calculations. Sure, I could write a program for my HP 32SII to do financial calculations. But why, when I can just key in the data directly to the HP12C, push dedicated financial keys, and get immediate answers. This calculator has most of the financial functions you need in a calculator (amortization, depreciation, NPV, date functions, etc.) along with the basic complement of standard calculator functions (ln, mean, standard deviation, factorial, etc). The complexity level is about right for a calculator. It doesn't take a computer science degree to operate it like the graphing calculators require, and it's far more capable than the $5 Walmart brands.*) Speed. I see reviews complaining that this calculator is slow when doing things like IRR computations. They're right. So what? If your IRR computation is that complicated, use a spreadsheet. If you're a college student taking exams, you're better off with a graphing calculator anyway. For 99% of the things the rest of us do with a calculator the 12C is more than fast enough, and the price of speed is power consumption. My 32SII is going on 10 years without a battery replacement, and I trust the 12C will have the same thrifty ways. It's a pain to need a quick answer, reach for the calculator, and then find the batteries are exhausted. This was a regular occurence when I owned TI and Casio brands. I've never had this problem with the HPs I've owned.It also has some programming capabilities which some may find useful. Personally, I haven't used the programming mode in a calculator for many years. Almost invariably I find it easier to just pull up a spreadsheet or write some code.I suspect the under-30 crowd will find this calculator--maybe the whole calculator premise--feels 'dated', and in a way they're right. However, if you're one of those who, like me, use these tools every day and always want one nearby, I think you'll like this calculator. For fit, finish, and a pleasant balance of performance with simplicity it seems to be on par with my earlier HP calculators. (Time will tell, I suppose, whether or not it has the same durability.) What is certain is that in the age of cellphones, PDAs and computers the era of high-quality long-lasting purpose-built calculators is going the way of the Dodo bird.",5,One of the last of an almost extinct species,1145404800,"04 19, 2006",Office Products

I used this in my graduate business program, and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive.

Many do; some don't.  RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb.  One of these lasted me decades.

But for most financial pros, if it can't be done on an HP12C, then you probably need a computer.The RPN system isn't hard to learn (at a basic level it works similar to an adding machine), and the functions on this calculator take input and spit out output in a way similar to Excel (i.e. negative numbers for payments and positive for future value, etc.). I found mine the other day after not using it for a while and immediately used it for a discounted cash flow quick analysis I was later planning to do in Excel.

There is a battery compartment on the back of the calculator but rest assured you don't need to use it; solar power or using this on a desk with a lamp will make a battery unnecessary.Overall, this is an excellent little calculator without the bells and whistles I just don't need.

A2A1XYSB692L6J,B00000JBLU,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[14, 17]","This review is for the SECOND version of this calculator, the slightly-larger, grey, BLACK and white model, with a rounded ""mound"" housing the keypad.  I had actually ordered the older model -- the light-grey model, with the blue and white keys, slightly smaller, which I had had previously, but sadly lost.  I had considered returning this newer model, but finally decided against it, as it is now listed as being discontinued by the manufacturer, so -- if I returned the newer one I did get, I very well might have gotten the same model back..........I was, at first, extremely disappointed in the newer model.  (Why both the newer model and the older model -- which look COMPLETELY DIFFERENT -- have the VERY SAME MODEL NUMBER is completely beyond me.  I mean, people who work at Texas Instruments are supposed to be very intelligent and know what they are doing....but why they decided to give to truly different calculators the same model number is something I don't think I'll ever understand.  I mean...what kind of ""genuis"" makes this very simple mistake?  (one who wants to fool online and catalogue buyers, who have to trust that the packers will pack the right model, perhaps>)That said, this NEWER model -- though larger and more-than-slightly bulkier than the older one -- does have a few advantages....I think.I don't remember the older model having a ""tax+"" or ""tax-"" or ""rate"" key, nor do I remember it having a battery backup, as the newer model does.This newer model has a nice little compartment for the battery, which need only be opened with a single screw.  So, the entire back of the calculator need not be taken off -- with the slight dangers, therein, of getting dust into the machine, or disturbing the delicate circuitry, in the half a minute or so, that it takes to change the battery.  With a neat little separate oompartment for the battery changing, the rest of the back of the machine need not be disturbed at all!This is all the more important, as more and more calculators, sadly, are made with ""no user-replaceable batteries"" enclosed, (no -- one is instructed, in these other, still newer calculators, to take them to the nearest authorized repair shop, of the designated manufacturer -- and have them replaced there, like wrist-watch batteries!  First wrist-watches, now calculators!  Talk about planned obsolence!  (Buy even this newer model 1795SV, and keep it close!)Although the newer model 1795sv has a ""wrap-around, windshield"" numberical display, (instead of what is to me, the far more esthetically pleasing and clearer, ""picture-frame"" numberical display, found in the older model 1795sv), the numbers still are well-spaced and clear to view.  It also has the nice, l a r g e numberic display, which is not only on this newer model 1795SV, but also on the older model 1795SV.....and also on the belated, dearly loved, and sadly lost original Texas Instrument ""1795"" model, (no ""sv""), which I once had, and enjoyed more than both of the ""1795sv"" models put together!  (It was small, handy, and a beautiful medium-bone-yellow in colour.  It also seemed to stay on FOREVER -- pr at least an hour or so, if I remember correctly.  Oh, that Texas Instruments would bring THAT model back, sigh!)Well, this NEW m0del 1795SV -- though NOT the older, handier model 1795SV, nor the original model 1795 -- still has many good points, most of which are delineated above.  It is also a desk-top model which can be carried in a pocket-book, if necessary -- and also in a briefcase, but not in a wallet.  It is bigger than the two previous models in the Texas Instrument 1795 line...but does have that priceless customer-replacable battery chamber.  Although I do prefer the previous two models, this newer one, now available, is not a bad little calculator, all things considered.But I would still welcome, (greatly!), the return of the original 1795 model, and/or the original 1795sv.",4,W O R T H....A....S E C O N D....L O O K....A N D...

Yes, the buttons are on the small side and there is a bit of play, but this was never a major problem (although at times it slows down data entry). You can go to [...] for a good overview of TI calculators, and you can scope out one of TI's major competitors at [...]A Little History:This was also one of the first commercially available low-priced calculators that had two-line display and backspace to correct or edit data entry.  The dual-power and scrolling display features were also once unusual.  The top line (for data entry) shows up to 11 characters; you can scroll backwards or forwards up to 88! The bottom line (shows results) displays up to a 10-digit answer along with a 2-digit exponent.Individual Needs Differ:From the reviews here, it appears that high school math is now more difficult than it once was.  If you know that you're going to need graphing capability, then obviously this is not the choice for you.  Similarly, the prevalence of laptop computers and math/stats software may obviate the need for some of the more advanced features.Recommendation:The layout is very good and, for such a low price, it packs a lot of calculating might.  However, high school (or college)students may want to narrow their choices and then ask their teacher which one has the most relevant functions for the next few years of math. Compared to twenty-five or so years ago, one can now get a lot more calculator for the money.

Apparently, TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However, the calculator is complicated to use, and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore, the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.

Yes, there are better, more advanced calculators out there for the advanced mathematics and scientific user.  And yes, this item should be priced much lower than it is, considering it has been on the market for a long time.  However, for use in an academic setting, consider that there exists a lot of  teaching materials out there in the classrooms, as well as activities, that are built around this model.  So, because of that, this model has survived all this time.I bought this calculator to use in a Corporate Finance class.  Calculating Time Value of Money problems with this was much easier than using the BA II Plus.  The inputs are easier to enter, without having to memorize long sequences of key strokes.Your instructor and the class activities will most likely dictate which brand and model of calculator to purchase, rather than a reviewer's recommendations.  However, one bit of advice I can give you is very important to remember:  Please, use regular 1.5v alkaline batteries should you purchase this model.  The rechargeable batteries, with their 1.2v, will not be enough to give you a clear display.  A set of four batteries will last a very long time.  However, it would not be a bad idea to carry a spare pack of 4 in your briefcase or backpack.  You would not want to run out of battery in the middle of an important exam.

AN81JUYW2SL24,B00000JBO8,Gearhead Mania,"[27, 42]","Parents: If you're going to buy your child a graphing calculator for school, DON'T insult his/her intelligence with this limited function calculator. Go with a TI-86 or TI-89 as it will serve him/her well through into college. What this means is you save money by purchasing one calculator that will be useful for SATs, GREs, AP tests, high school, algebra, calculus 1-3, college, etc...If you buy a TI-83, you will have to get a TI-86 or TI-89 in the future because a TI-83 is an OVERGLORIFIED TI-82, which is really good for pre-algebra and algebra.GRANTED you can use a TI-83 for Calculus and more advanced math, but it's a good idea to allow your child to grow intellectually by learning how to use a much more advanced calculator for Calc II and III. I had no problems using a TI-86 for Calc 2 and 3, but the TI-89 definitely helped me understand theorems that were in 3 dimensions.For those who are looking for a calculator to use at work:The TI-83 is a piece of junk. It's for kiddies in 6th grade.The TI-86 is a better engineering calc than the TI-89 due to its more intuitive menu interface for units conversions and what not.The TI-89 is better suited for theoretical math work because of its ""pretty print"" and units system. Plus with the right software mods, you can do differentiation/integration with the variables intact - just a time saver really.However I realize you're just trying to find info on the TI-83. My overall recommendation for the TI-83 is: don't bother. It's a solid calculator but pay a bit more and get at least a TI-86. It will serve you WELL into frosh or sophomore year of college (Calculus I-III). A TI-83 will have served its absolute purpose by the start of your senior year in high school.It's like bringing a 9mm pistol in an African Safari. It will handle meerkats and other small creatures but once you get to the larger predators - it will not work very well. The TI-86 and TI-89 is comparable to a .50AE and .50 Magnum.

No matter what you will always find yourself using one of these calculators in high school, they are very powerful calculators that have a great advantage over a standard calculator because it has the ability to have programs on it and because it is a graphing calculator. These calculators can even be used during tests such as the SAT! It gives you a better advantage if you know how to use one of these well. The only downside to these calculators is that they require 4 AAA batteries, they last a pretty long time though because the screen doesn't take up much power. Some people might complain that the screen is too low resolution to today's standards or that it isn't a backlit screen,  but this screen is what allows for greater battery use, you wouldn't want your calculator to power off during an exam.

Martin ""Darkbard""","[0, 0]","Bottom-Line: The Texas Instruments ""TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator"" is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career, it is just that powerful.It's time for me to head back to school, DeVry University's Keller Graduate School of Management that is.  This time I am in pursuit of my MBA with a concentration in Networking and Telecommunications. Why pursue a boring ole traditional MBA when new technology is to be learned?  So that means math; lots of math; loads of math in the form of algebra, calculus, and the ever dread statistics.Did I mention that I hate math!?  What does one do when one hates math, but still needs to do it in spades?  Buy a calculator of course, but not just any calculator I needed a calculator cable of doing complex mathematics including graphing equations.  My very first course called for a Texas Instruments ""TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator.""Powered by (4) AAA-sized batteries (plus 1 CR-1616 or CR 1620 lithium battery for backup), the ""TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator"" is large unit ideal for advanced mathematics students high school algebra to college-level calculus, and statistics.  The TI-83 Plus packs a lot of mathematical punch and the price of $127.00 (Office Depot.com) certainly confirms it.The TI-83 Plus calculator combines features for statistical analysis, engineering, trigonometric and financial functions making it ideal for a student seeking an MBA.  Financial functions include TVM, cash flows and amortization, though surprisingly a percentage key is missing from the calculator.The two pound (yes, it is heavy, kind of) TI-83 Plus features a non-backlit 64x96 pixel grey scale LCD screen that is frankly hard to read unless the lighting is exactly right.  But the LCD display can display graphs and tables on a full as well as split-screen.  And the display exhibits up to (12) characters and eight lines.  The calculator can graph/trace equations while scrolling through table values.  And the TI-83 Plus can store and analyze up to 10 equations.I also purchased the optional TI-Graph Link (software and USB cable).  The software and cable allows one to connect the TI-83 Plus to a computer via a USB port permitting the transfer of files and data between the two devices.My ThoughtsAmple time should be given to learning what the TI-83 Plus can bring to the table.  All of the nine digits are there of course, but the face of the calculator contains a whole lot more in the form of multi-colored special function buttons; and there are a lot of them!  However, the TI-83 Plus ships with very detailed, instruction manual, so I plan to carry it with me at all times.As I stated above, and it is worth restating, the TI-83 Plus's non-backlit LCD is a little difficult to read when the unit is lying flat on a desk and a lot will depend on the lighting conditions.  Even with the right lighting, the top line of the display is hard to read.Though I was stunned by the high price of the unit the ""Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator"" is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career, it is just that powerful.

This is larger than a typical greeting card, but the size makes it easy to use with just about any printer. The paper accepts and absorbs the ink without seeping through or veining in the paper fibers. The paper color is not bright white, but is appropriate for a greeting card.The package insert, dated 2007, states that Avery DesignPro software is Windows only. However, Avery DesignPro for Mac OSX is now available as a free download on the Avery.com software page. Avery DesignPro for Mac is a basic graphic design and layout program which includes templates for most Avery products, including Avery/American Greetings Half Fold Blank Cards (3265). This is the easiest way I know of to use this kind of product. In addition, Avery DesignPro includes a printer calibration feature. Absolute precision is not so critical on greeting cards, but if you're printing 90-per-page return address labels, a fraction of an inch one way or the other can run a whole sheet of labels.My printer (an HP 7180) has a duplex (two-sided printing) attachment. The DesignPro software will print both sides on the same job. The trick is to choose Short-edge Binding in the print dialog box. If you choose long-edge, the inside of the card will print upside down on the wrong page. The preview in the print dialog box does not show the inside page, but it does print. If your printer does not have a duplex attachment, then you simply print page 1 only, flip the paper over and then print page 2 only. I'd suggest trying this once or twice with plain paper, so you know exactly how to flip the paper for your particular printer.To me, these products fall in the etiquette scale between  a hand-written note on your personal letterhead and a greeting card you bought in the grocery store.

The template I downloaded did not have any envelope printing option; there was only a template for the card.  Designing the card took a little bit of experimenting before I got the writing and picture to be organized correctly in the template.  There are really no guides in the template. It also took me a while to orient the paper correctly in the printer, but once that worked, the output of the picture on the card cover was rich.This is for inkjet printers only and before I selected this product, I had missed that description.  I did try it in my laser printer with the duplex option set and the card stock got jammed as expected.  However, it did print the front of the card beautifully before that happened.  I then printed a saying on regular paper and glued it to the back of the card.  Obviously, if you have an inkjet printer, you won't have to do this. Instead, I had my friend use this product on her inkjet printer. Below is her review:""The paper has the perfect weight for card stock.  The paper fed through my printer with ease each time (not too thick), and it worked well for double sided printing with no bleed through.  Both black and color ink printed perfectly.  I would purchase this brand card stock paper again.""In summary, if you like printing your own cards and have an inkjet printer, then this Avery product is a good option.",4,Template for card stock works well once you get the hang of it,1291334400,"12 3, 2010",Office Products

In the past, I have had greeting card papers jam or refuse to feed unless the paper goes in from the top, but I had no difficulties with either printer in this case. The colors were a bit richer coming from the Epson printer, and I'm sure it's because that printer utilizes six ink cartridges and is designed more specifically for photo printing. However, the results were very close, and I was very happy with the prints from both machines. Colors are bright and clear, and the details are sharp. The cards have a nice feel to them and the scoring in the middle of the sheets make them very easy to fold cleanly and evenly. With the matte finish, the ink is dry and okay to handle as soon as the prints come out of the printer.

Avery White Half-Fold Greeting Cards are nice to have to quickly and easily create a nice looking card. The paper is sturdier and nicer looking than normal printer paper.  I think at a half page size, they are a little big and the envelopes are a little cheap looking.  My huge recommendation is to always print your card on a piece of normal paper to make sure it is right before using this paper. Since I messed one up, I printed a half page size card. I like that size better, but then you need to have your own envelopes or do without. Making two per page would make the cards more economical, too. It is very easy to find pre-made designs that fit this template size. Even a beginner could make a card in minutes. I used a non-color laser printer and by choosing a black and white design, the cards look great.

I assumed that the same card (same pictures, words and fonts) would look about the same on them both.  After all, they were both Avery products.  To test my theory, I test-printed the same thing (using the same fonts and the same picture) on both cards.  I was amazed at the difference!  The words were sharper and clearer on these cards.  However, where they really stood out was the clarity of the picture!  The picture on the other card was acceptable -- until I put them side-by-side for comparison!  On this card, the colors were more vivid, and the picture was a lot sharper.  In fact, when compared to this card-stock, the picture on the less expensive paper looked faded and washed out (something I probably would've never noticed if I hadn't seen the side-by-side comparison).  I'm still having a hard time believing that different card-stock can make such a diffence.  The difference really is that noticeable.  These more expensive half fold cards are definitely worth the extra expense, and I will buy them in the future.I also like that you can download free templates from [&#8230;] templates (something that is true of all Avery products).  When using Avery's free templates, you have four options:1 - Avery Templates (a simple and basic download, and it works with MS Word & Adobe programs);2 - Avery Wizard for MS Office (a download that gives more options than the basic option and makes MS Word even easier to use);3 - Avery Design & Print Online (Online version that does not require a download, unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to do single labels without printing an entire page of the same label);4 - Avery DesignPro (a download that allows even more features than basic or MS Office templates.

A3FS3FJPD3RJTD,B00000JFNV,"Sunday ""SundayAtDusk""","[0, 0]","It's been a while since I've used actual greeting card paper to make my photo greeting cards.  The first time I made greeting cards on a PC, I used HP greeting card paper, which I found on clearance.  I loved making photo cards!  Unfortunately, I realized greeting card paper was a bit costly when not on clearance, so I turned to other paper for my cards.  Mostly, I have made them onCanon Matte Photo Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches, 50 Sheets (7981A004).  (Note, however, I have not bought this paper since 2005, when I stocked up on it, because it was so cheap.  Thus, I don't know if Canon has changed anything about the paper or not.  The box itself looks different.)  It is basically inexpensive photo paper, and has no Canon name on the reverse side, so you can print your greetings on that side.  (Just make certain you print the photo on the right side.  If not, it will look horrendous, whereas words look just fine.  Hold the paper up to a lamp to find the brightest white side for the photo.)  It also folds relatively easily.  If you want your card on glossy paper, use glossy photo paper for your photograph, pastel or bright bonded paper for your message, and tape or paste the bonded paper to the back of the glossy paper. (All glossy paper I have ever seen has the brand's name on the back, so messages can't be printed there.)  Then, just get a box of envelopes that fit your cards, such asColumbian CO468 Grip-Seal Invitation Envelopes A9, 5-3/4"" x 8-3/4"" - White (Box of 100).If you want it quick and easy, though, do get these Avery greeting cards.  The envelopes are included, and the card paper is already half folded, so there's no struggle in getting the card folded just right.  The photos I printed on these cards looked almost as good as the photos printed on matte photo paper.  I used 10 of these Avery cards to make a stationery set for friends.  I printed photos of their dogs on the front of the cards, and left the insides blank for ""newsy"" notes.  Since the envelopes in this pack come bounded in two sets of ten, that worked out quite well.  I included one of the envelope sets with the cards, and had a very nice Christmas gift for my friends. I don't think the included envelopes are quite as nice as the Columbian ones, but they certainly will do. Also, when making a quarter card, while folding the half card in half, the card tore in half!  So, you might want to watch out for that, or get quarter card paper for your smaller cards.

Aside from the typical print-out greeting cards, I use the cardstock for a couple of other things as well: (1) They're scored deeply enough that they rip in half easily. Once ripped in half, I cut along the line to make it look neater, fold each half of cardstock in half, and then make two handmade cards out of one sheet. (2) The cardstock works really well as a cover when creating half-fold booklet projects.One thing that's different about this product from others is that it comes with envelopes. Plenty of other brands only sell cardstock in packs, and this envelope size isn't always easy to find. The printing is also less likely to smear than some other types of heavy paper since the surface isn't glossy.The only negative I have to say is that this packet used to come with 25 cards and envelopes (my old box reads: ""5 more cards! Now with 25 cards.""). I really wish Avery had kept the pack at a larger size and not taken it back down to 20.

A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN,B000068NSX,Charlo,"[3, 3]","I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-",5,So far so good.

The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2"" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8"", but this is 3/4"".There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.  You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4"" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2"" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter!I also noticed, this hose also has less tendency to kink.",5,More powerful water flow,1314144000,"08 24, 2011",Patio Garden

I don't do much in the way of gardening, nor wash my car that often.  So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.

A27DDHWHE540I5,B00002N67Q,Pie Grrrl,"[80, 81]","I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a ""brake"" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose.

It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly &#8211;e.g., it's not an even &#34;circle&#34; of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging.

AI0BCEWRE04G0,B00002N68C,Stoney,"[111, 114]","Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get ""prettier"" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if ""pretty"" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a ""lock on"" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no ""medium"" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual ""problem"", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is ""too good""---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a ""closed"" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then ""open 'er up"" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT ""Gilmour 572TF"".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in ""bargain bin"" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a ""Gilmour 572TF"", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the ""Gilmour 572TF"", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those ""prettier"" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in ""bargain bins"", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a ""pretty"" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will ""sacrifice"" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) ""pretty"" sprayer nozzles, which have ""fallen out of favor"" for various reasons.",5,Does the Job,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",Patio Garden

Convenience alone makes this sprinkler really attractive, but it does a good job and that is a real draw.Operation is easy. Extend the garden hose where you want to water as the hose is the 'track' that the Raintrain runs on. By adjusting the time and the pressure you essentially control where you water and the degree of water used. Then sit back and enjoy as  the Raintree does the work.

A1LACH6MLQWZ,B00002N6AN,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","There are some positive features about the Nelson Raintree Traveling Sprinkler that makes is an excellent sprinkler, and a good one to have if one has a large lawn. It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a &#34;traveling&#34; sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards. Also, we have tree rings and the like, which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest. We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts. So, buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.Second, it is a very heavy sprinkler.

AXAJXJZUL2J5P,B00002N6AN,D. Scott,"[365, 406]","I've had my Raintrain for a little over a year now.  I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:>For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, ""sprinkler watching"" seems to be a common phenomenon.>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.>It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.>I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on ""low gear,"" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.>While the sprinkler seems overall pretty solid and durable, I knocked a big chip of paint off the ""nose"" when I set it up on end to attach the hose, and the bare spot rusted immediately.>Laying out the hose for a straight line is simple, but if you want to do any curves, it takes a lot of practice and trial and error to create a path that won't make the Raintrain ""jump the track.""  The tightness of curve it can handle depends on several factors, such as the height and density of the grass, the softness of the ground, and any small bits of yard debris the wheels might go over.>The stop valve on the underside (which is triggered by the stop block) stopped working on mine during its second season.  Now when it runs over the stop block, it slows down, and the arms start turning more slowly, but it doesn't actually stop.  This greatly reduced the handiness of the Raintrain for me.Overall, this is a fun sprinkler, and it has its uses, but I've decided to try something else this summer.  The Raintrain is just too cumbersome and time-consuming to set up for my particular needs.",3,"Fun and functional, but a lot of work",1183420800,"07 3, 2007",Patio Garden

I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough.

A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ,B00002N6AN,Tom,"[2, 2]","I own a yard where either the person who planted the trees or the one who ran the irrigation pipes needed a few more lessons about what happens ten years later when that 6' tree becomes a 25 footer and the roots are wrapped around the pipe that was laid 12"" away from it.Because of a variety of issues from shallow topsoil with an uneven granite underlay to existing water/sewer/power lines to heavy tree and root growth, new pipes just aren't in the cards.  Every year I turn on the sprinkler system and start fixing busted pipes and sprinkler heads that have been pushed off by a root.  I've been very lucky so far, I've been able to repair all but one of them.  Once I found myself up to my armpit in a hole not much bigger than my arm, through dense roots where I managed to glue a new pipe piece in.Clearly this sort of stuff takes a lot of time to fix sometimes, and in the meanwhile hand watering my half acre in 100 degree, 0% humidity summers is just a no-go.Enter the Rain Train, because its time to make it rain! :)You lay out a hose path for this, no sharp turns, and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit.  Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop, and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it.  Turn on the water and set to high or low (high goes faster, disperses less water per square inch) and go do something else for a while.  You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage, then use the faucet to fine tune it.I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it wouldn't make it uphill, but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain.  On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement.  How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit, then through the two wands which spin, turning a gear that turns the wheels.  Simple and ingenious.I've only had it jump off the hose once, and thats when I made a real hairpin turn to see if it could make it.  Do note that if it jumps the hose it'll go off in some semi-random arc until it runs out of hose.  So while its tempting to set it and go to bed or leave for the day, you might want to check on it once in a while.This is also very handy for those really dry areas where I want to apply a lot of water to a decent sized spot but I dont want to have to remember to keep moving a sprinkler and to turn it off.  This is a nice time and water saver.For those times when I lose a pipe, its also nice to know I have a week or so to fix it and can get the coverage I need from the Rain Train.  This wont ever replace a full sprinkler system, but it'd be fine for watering a really large area that hasn't been fitted with an irrigation system yet, or as I use it for large spot overwatering and temporary irrigation replacement.",5,I love my Rain Train!,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",Patio Garden
A2582KMXLK2P06,B00002N8K3,B. E Jackson,"[16, 24]","It's hard writing a review for this Flexogen garden hose because it has a couple big problems, but something else about it makes up for that one problem. Read on:One thing you have to know- pretty much ANY garden hose you buy will tangle if you don't wrap it the right way. However, some hoses it won't matter if you don't do a good job wrapping it. Unfortunately, others (like this one) are sort of cheap and get knotted easily, so you DO have to take the time to wrap it correctly or else the hose will be damaged over time. I guess if you're not the type of person that wraps the hose when you're done with it (and just leave it sit in the yard) none of this will matter. But in my house we have to wrap the hoses.This means, if you drag the hose across the yard, you might have to go back and straighten out the knots because knots WILL most likely happen. And they will happen in three or four different spots on the hose. To me that's a sign of a bad hose. If one knot occurs that's ok. More than one knot and the hose is bad.However, the one thing that makes up for the knot problem is that I've NEVER had a problem with this hose squirting water where it shouldn't. You see, it's hard for me to say whether this Flexogen hose is bad or good. It has problems, but if you can deal with the knot problem you will have a good hose that will last a long time.I'd say using it just to wash your car isn't a bad idea, but dragging the hose across the yard to rinse off things (and water the garden) IS a bad idea because the knots will continue to occur, so you'll have to keep walking all the way back to where the hose begins to straighten it out.

AV866OAD7CRWY,B00002N8K3,Neschie Smith,"[12, 12]","UPDATE:  Originally, I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them (I bought 3) for a while, I've changed my opinion. Yes, the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses, but Flexogens are still heavy. These Flexogen hoses DO kink, and they kink easily. The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel, lay it flat on the grund, and then turn and turn and turn (twist/rotate) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no ""waves"" or loops. I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and, holding the end, walked across my yard. I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling. The hose formed 9 kinks! What a pain in the hand, elbow and shoulder to straighten it! This process wastes time.The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water, this hose becomes unwieldy. The hose turns so that my wand is upside down. It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward--requires using both hands. Fighting this hose is painful, very tiring and aggravating.When you rewind it onto a hose reel, the hose twists and turns, causing it to again form waves and loops, which become kinks. Again, you have to twist, rotate, etc. to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground. As you reel it in, you have to stop and repeat the process. My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this. You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses (100 ft) at big box stores and clubs for about $25. Don't buy the Flexogen.Due to age and arthritis in my hands, I needed to replace my heavy, rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight, easier-to-maneuver hoses. I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard. After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses, I chose this hose. I'm glad I did. While it's still heavy, it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose. It's easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.The Amazon description calls this a ""lightweight"" hose. It is NOT  light. It's substantial. I found a local store that  had this hose in 25-, 50- and 75-ft lengths. I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length. I couldn't feel much of a difference, so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose (but lighter than my rubber one).This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it's more flexible. (I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years.)I've only used one (I bought 3 of these) for about 1.5 weeks. It's been too hot, too muggy and too rainy to use it much, but I'm pleased so far. I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years. The solid brass fittings are thick so they won't get dents that cause leaks. Because I haven't dragged it around the yard yet, I cannot say whether it really is a ""no-kink"" hose. I recommend this hose because o the quality.",1,UPDATE:  Kinks Easily & Difficult to Handle,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",Patio Garden

Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose. Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company (Gilmour) won't honor the warranty.

I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses.

After that, edging is a snap because you are basically in maintanence mode.I also use this around my landscaping and flower beds with equally great results.The blade on the Edge Hog is easily replaceable and the tell tale sign to replace it is when the edge starts to look a little rough and the machine seems slower.",5,Big Timesaver,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",Patio Garden

I could have bought the replacement parts and changed them out for $30, but then I decided to just get a new one.  There are a couple of changes between the older and the newer model.  The new unit is lighter and seems to have more power, though that may be because of the new brushes working better.  The one BIG change is the guard over the blade.  It is too soon to tell if this is an improvement or just a way to save money on their part.  It certainly is less safe.The older model had a &#34;swing open&#34; cover which protected the blade almost completey above the ground level.  Good part about that was not being able to get fingers or toess into the cutting area.  Bad part was having to stop for built up grass, or when the ground was wet, built up mud.  You'd have to stop and open the door to clean out the area.The newer model doesnot have a cover and most of the blade area is open.  There is something akin to a bicycle fender covering the blade for protection.  The first day I used it, the ground was wet and dirt built up in the shield, but not enough to really bog down the blade.  I unplugged the unit for safety sake, but unlike the older model, you needed a big screwdriver to pull out all the mud.  If you use it on dry ground, the newer model will have less build up of grass than the older one.I am hoping to get at least eight years out of this unit, like I did with my last one.",5,Had to replace my eight year old model,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",Patio Garden

We have St. Augustine grass here in Florida.  It propagates by spreading tough, vine-like runners.  I had these in spades creeping over my driveway and over onto the concrete rain channel gutter in front of our house.  This edger cut right through them, which I didn't expect, given the toughness of the grass.  But it never hesitated, except on some very stuborn growth.  I just backed up and hit it again and away the edger went, without even breathing hard.  Even the gas-powered edger wasn't this good.The secondary handle and the adjustable edge guide are quite helpful.  I never felt like this edger had taken control and gone where I didn't want it to go.  Its light weight, easy rolling wheels and great cutting power more than compensate for the 100-ft extension cord it's tethered to.  I think it took me as long to rewind the cord as it took to edge the grass (total edging is about 200-225 linear feet).  Also it has two large wheels in the back and one at the front, so it stays level and makes it easy to push in a straight line.  With the edge guide that rides against the driveway or walkway there was very little of the sparking caused by the blade hitting the concrete.This is about as easy as it gets.  No more gas and oil mix, no more new spark plugs, no more 15-20 pulls to get the engine to start, and it's relatively quiet when running.  Just press the trigger and go.

Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool, but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you, disposable spools are the way to go.

It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in.

Garrelts,"[2, 2]","My wife and I have a six month old baby boy and around the 4-month mark my wife decided that she would return to work instead of being a stay-at-home mom. We hired an in-home nanny to care for our little boy and the arrangement has worked quite well ever since. Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones. The legibility in the Baby Tracker is a huge improvement over our standard notebook entries that really ended up becoming small paragraphs. In a few short moments you can summarize all of the data in the columns in the totals section and determine key information - how much did baby eat, did baby have a bowel movement, how much sleep did they get, etc.There are, however, some frustrating limitations with this journal. First the entire layout is about half a notebook sheet divided down the middle (portrait layout). This constrains entries to very small spaces on each column and row. For much of the information that is okay - feedings can be summarized in ounces; diaper changes by a &#34;#1 or #2&#34; and so on. However, once your baby becomes more active and you'd like to know more than &#34;tummy time&#34; under the play-time column things start to get very tight on the page.Another problem is that this tracker only covers 12 hours out of a baby's day. That's fine if the intention is only to track hours while a baby is with child care providers. However, we really wanted to track our little boy's entire day which often starts much earlier than 6am. Using this journal that would require the use of a second page.--------------------WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(+) Good layout that is easy to read and instantly gather information about your baby's day in a matter of moments(+) High quality paper(+) Consistent quality between the pages--------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(-) Expensive and gets you at most 6-months, less if you use more than one page for tracking your babies entire day(-) The cover is thick but not a hardback and bends easily in a diaper bag(-) The pages should really be bigger. I understand portability is a concern but the current size is entirely too small--------------------CONCLUSION:I ended up making my own format of this journal in a spreadsheet that includes a 24-hour day and more space for comments along with a few other changes and had the pages bound cheaply at a local shop. This is an adequate journal but expensive for what you get and limitations because of page size.",3,Expensive and Somewhat Limited Format,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",Baby

When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.

Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6""), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted ""No Trucks"" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.

A3N7T0DY83Y4IG,528881469,C. A. Freeman,"[43, 45]","Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.",3,1st impression,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",Electronics

I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6"" bridges when I'm 13'6"". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints.

A2KQDWZZUBBNOJ,972683275,Bradley Pool,"[0, 0]","I used it to mount a 32"" LCD TV to the wall... about 28LBS.  I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit ""off level"" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.",4,It works!,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",Electronics

If you want it on just pull the lens out a bit.

A35W3JQYP0M655,1933622865,"John Thomas... ""New England...USA""","[68, 87]","I recently saw this at a local AC Moore store.  They had one open so you could try it out.  I only tried it for less than 10 minutes but that was enough.  Personally I think this is one of the worst ideas I have seen in a long time that is a product of one of those annoying TV commercials.  The idea of it is that it supposed to be easier to hold this thing over your book and hover it there continuously while you read, as opposed to just wearing glasses, ....Or something. (I think a newer model I saw on TV recently has a light, but that doesn't come off as any improvement on it in my opinion).  No question that if you get this thing just right it can magnify the page of your book or whatever it is you are using it for, but the fact that it actually works is where the benefits of this thing ends.  For starters, even if you are not reading one of the books that requires two hands for it closes on you the second you relax your grip on it,(as most of them are), this thing has to be positioned just right all the time in order to magnify the page successfully.  Move it back and forth just a little and your page becomes a blur.  There are no attachments to this thing, your hand is the tool, and in no time you start to have it get tired, go to sleep, etc.  There is not even a handle anywhere on this thing.  You just hold it someplace along the edge where you can sometimes find yourself magnifying nothing but your own finger.  Lastly, this thing is not glare resistant.  Depending on your light source, you will occasionally have to move or adjust it just to see.  Or better yet, forget about it it all together which is what I suggest overall.  There are several of these page magnifiers available here on Amazon.  The cheaper ones are much smaller.  Actually, I think a smaller ones is a wiser investment than this more expensive full page model.  The smaller one can be a handy tool to have around when you are trying to read that horrible tiny print on such things as medicine bottles, instructions, etc.  And its much cheaper than this model.  No matter what you have in mind for this Mighty Bright, I suggest you move on.

Anyways, Let me begin by saying there are few things more subjective than a fragrance, especially a woman's fragrance. I'm a woman (and proud) and I know how finicky we can be.

I'm going to explain the ingredients . . .Yes you heard me . .the ingredients . . .Sure . .The /are/ listed here, but do you really know what they are . . .I'm not going to explain them all, but hopefully enough to help you understand the science of the scent as well as the actually scent itself. H'okay, here we go!*Centaurea Cyanus = the common Cornflower aka ""bluebottle"" aka the Buttonierre Flower*Squalene (which may or may not come from the bladder of a shark {most likely its just synthetically created now}) = a natural moisturizer. It penetrates the skin quickly, but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling (not to mention the fact that Squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins)*Glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs (aka the flowers) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent.*Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis aka ""Sweet Almond"" (think Amaretto) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance (durrr)*Cetyl Alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*Cetyl Palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . .*Gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .It's used in all types of cosmetics . ..Mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils (I'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . )*Polysorbate 60 is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . .*As for Dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a ""skin protectant"" whatever that means  . . . .*Jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly, it's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil (some scientists even claim it's superior to whale oil)*Tocopherol contains Vitamin E which is considered good for the skin :-)*shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . .*Triethanolamine = a Ph balancer (makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever isn't too acidic*Citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .It should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .It also contains Vitamin E which is good . . .*Lavandula Stoechas is simply a type of lavander. it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . .*rosa gallica = a type of Rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*There are multiple other flowers added to the mix so I would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .As for some beaty tips considering this scent I'd say it's of moderate strength, it lasts around 8 hours or so, it's a casual scent . .not to fancy, but definitely far from plain; and I'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent.

My fault, I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later I get it. It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.Me - 28 this month. V shaped hairline. Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about.

AQX8T9SFFK43U,B00004TMFE,Kristina Montes,"[3, 4]","6/8/2013, first review: I thought to review this product as time goes on. I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.",4,Losing less hair!

A1ACH77RG6C8MN,B00004TMFE,VirtualGrace,"[0, 0]","I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)",2,"Industrial strength degreaser.

It's closer to 50% with empty bottles, still pretty crappy. If you're lucky, just the tip will break and you'll still be able to use it, though it will gt clogged and make a big mess on the wall. If the neck breaks, it's a goner.Aside from that (which is a big con--I would probably not choose the same design unless they changed the type of plastic in use or the design of the bottles), it's a nice dispenser and makes for a  clean shower without a bunch of cruddy-bottled half-filled bottles.

So why, you ask did I buy a second one???  Because one day recently as soon as I'd begun to lift the lid to check the level of soap in the bottles, one of them slipped out onto the shower floor and shattered into about 100 pieces.  I'd clearly seated it in properly the last time I took it out or else the lid wouldn't have closed in the first place.  Also, the unit was never bumped, jostled or anything else that would have caused the bottle to come loose.  So...manufacturing defect?  I think so.Anyway, I ended up contacting Better Living to ask about a replacement bottle and was hoping for a courteous, &#34;we'll send you one free of charge since it's our crappy product's fault.&#34;  Instead, I was directed to a link on their website where you can purchase replacement parts (this is likely where they make most of their money).  At over $5 for a cheap plastic bottle that I now know will shatter if dropped three feet, I was loath to buy one but basically had no choice.  I added it to my cart and during checkout found out that they don't ship to military APO addresses (which have California zip codes, BTW).  I contacted the company and told them about my dilemma and they basically told me to get lost.  Customer service really IS dead.So now here I am writing a glowing review of the entirely new dispenser I had to purchase just so that I could get a replacement bottle for my soap and have some spare ones for when the others inevitably break.

I wanted to get rid of all the bottles and tubes in my tub as they were forever landing by my feet causing a risk for me to fall. This unit is superb. It was easy to install if you follow the clear instructions. Once up it takes 24 hours for the glue to cure and then you can fill the pumps. The bottles are quite large so you do not have to refill to often. Included in the package are labels so you can choose which pump goes for shampoo or shower gel or soap. I do not use conditioner so I used 3 pumps for shower gels and 1 for my shampoo. The products flow freely once you prime the pumps and so far there has not been a problem in pumping out generous amounts of gel and shampoo. It looks neat and clean in the tub and shower. It can be removed safely by sliding a knife down the back of the unit to disengage the silicone glue strips. It does not come with extra glue so if you were to move it you would have to purchase some silicone glue and about 4 contact strips which can easily be obtained in any store with hardware.

ABFAO09KLTIFL,B00004TUBL,R. Reviewer,"[0, 0]","I installed this thing about a week ago. Overall, very positive. I have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!",4,Works great.,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",Beauty

Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days.

The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.",2,"Works Fine, But It Died On ME",1340582400,"06 25, 2012",Cell Phones and Accessories

A1F7YU6O5RU432,1608299953,Angela Streiff,"[0, 0]","Since learning a language from software is not exactly the same as learning a language from going to live in the country itself, I suggest picking up the Rosetta Stone software 1 level at a time, like this French level 1. That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, there's not always time for that either. Sometimes there's just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or maybe you just don't want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program. Instead it's interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you've learned to help retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they don't end up missing anything along the way. I'm more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people.",5,"Suggest getting this 1 level at a time, so you know if you can learn from the program",1365465600,"04 9, 2013","Clothing,Shoes,Jewelry"

I researched this product a great deal before purchasing and even got the free demo CD first.  I really do like the learning process, it feels intuitive.  The problem is, sitting at my desktop computer is inconvenient and I do not have a laptop.  So when I learned that there is an ""App for that"", I was thrilled.  I own both an iPhone and an iPad so with the Rosetta Stone apps that link directly to my account I could learn and practice wherever I needed to.  For three months I made great progress whether at home, in the backyard or at work on my lunch hour.  On day 91 I suddenly could not connect, my apps kept saying ""no course found for this account"".  The product still works on my desktop but it turns out the apps portion of the product was just a free trial.  If I want to continue learning this way I need to purchase a very expensive subscription.  No where on this product page does it say that the companion apps are a trial version.  I am very disappointed with Rosetta Stone and Amazon.  I did call Amazon but the rep I spoke to did not know whether the product info was written by Rosetta Stone or Amazon, I am sure it was the former.  Amazon did try to assist me by offering a partial refund but that was not really what I wanted.  I want to continue to learn on my iPad!  My disappointed with Amazon is because that call I made to them took place about two months ago and I see the product info page has not changed, I do not see anything about the iPhone apps being a 90 day trial.UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013I see that Amazon has updated the description slightly with this sentence, ""Enhance your learning on-the-go with Rosetta Stone mobile apps for the Kindle Fire HD, iPad and iPhone.

I ended up putting the 2nd installation on a laptop, expecting to use the program in other locations.  However, Rosetta Stone's immersion method feels too intensive to me for use in most places away from home.  Installation was easy enough even though the program got stuck a couple of times along the way. The gear, headset with microphone, is sufficient.Pros:* For total immersion-type instruction without the benefit of communicating with other people, this seemed very good.* The voice recognition software is impressive. I was able to immediately begin speaking and progressed to the second level of difficulty fairly quickly. There are plenty of exercises and repetition, and this will surely help in many ways including pronunciation.* There are learning sessions in this software to allow speaking with native French speakers.*For me as an individual, this is a better way to learn than a formal classroom.Cons:* The limitation in the number of seats (2). This wasn't a problem for me yet it's something to know about.* Lack of matching supplemental physical material such as index cards with conjugations and grammatical rules.

This was my first experience with Rosetta Stone software and I like it. They really did one heck of a job making learning fun and easy. I highly recommend the software if you want to learn a second language, it looks like it is a good product. I would definitely try other languages after seeing just how easy it is to use this stuff.What didn't I like?For starters the headphones and microphone that came with it are NOT quality, they are not comfortable and my ears got really hot. It was like wearing styrofoam balls over my ear[...]. Sure wish they headphones were at least padded better. The microphone seemed to work well, my only gripe here is the comfort of wearing it. And if you follow this program you will wear it a lot!Second, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to install the software. I understand software piracy but between the lengthy install process, having to scratch off a 28 digit code from a little plastic card and manually enter that and the several updates I had to download it was a bit dull. I sure would have like a faster, easier program to install. So don't think you can just pop this in and you are good to go, you need to first install the application, then install the language pack, then update it (if updates are available) then you need to scratch off the secret code and activate the product, then you have to setup your user profile and THEN you can finally get started.Overall the product is good, I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the software is really the key here. The headset is low quality and that takes away from the experience. I would almost they NOT provide a headset then provide the one they did. And second the install was lengthy. I got the french lesson, I don't want to have to install the application and then a language pack.

Bilingual; What do you call a person who speaks one language?  American.I have wanted to improve my language status for many years.  My High School Latin teacher said that after I learned Latin, the other romance languages would be easy.  I considered the other romance languages (Spanish, Portugese, Italian. Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought.  Of course the grammar I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier.  Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is limited in grammar.  After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human.  Soon I remembered my years living in Germany.  I had studied German, but could not really have a meaningful conversation with a German.  When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American).  Those who did not speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words.  The lesson for me is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language.  Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends.  I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan.  I am unlikely to encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it.

A3I1BJIFFM4S21,1617160377,Atomicwasteland,"[8, 8]","Never having studied Italian before, and never having used Rosetta Stone before, I was definitely excited to give it a go and find out what all the hype was about.I went through the whole lesson over the course of a couple of months, spending only about a day or two a week on it.In the end, I think it was a smart system, one that has specific advantages, but also marked disadvantages.POSITIVES:+++ IMMERSION TECHNIQUE -there is no English.  you will only see pictures and hear Italian.  This means you'll learn more effectively, as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own.  Additionally, when you see pictures, for example, of a ""male"", the picture will be different each time: one time might be a young boy, and then it might be an old man, then a young man, and so on... and the first time you see the picture you might think it is a boy, but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else, and you relate the two, and pick the commonality.  Anyway, this is a hard example, and it is simpler than this, but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word, each time.++ WELL DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension, reading, pronunciation, typing, and so on.  It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was happy to find out that many of the concepts came back --not right away, but later when they weren't the freshest in my mind-- this meant I had to remember it, and basically memorized it through this recall.  I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on.  I did not feel the need to review previous lessons...++ PAINLESS.  This system is about as fun (can I say that?) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES:--- PRICE, PRICE, PRICE -for most people the $200 cost for a single lesson (less as you buy more modules) is really too high.  Yes I know these things cost money, and I know they are better than other systems, but the pricing suggests that they are worried you won't like it, and you'll feel pressured to continue because you spent so much, OR, they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set.  I'd argue they'd be better off dropping the price in half for the first module, and then I'd recommend it more.  (And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately.  I am not going to buy multiple modules without buying the first one, and testing it out.  $500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first.)- READING EXERCISES ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes (unsuccessfully) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable, and the voice recognition system fails.  I mean, I KNOW what I am hearing, I have studied 4 languages, have good pronunciation, and I can't for the life of me get the computer to believe I said ""PO"" (for example) instead of something unrecognizable.  It was very frustrating, as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable, with no luck.  Yet, when It was a multi-syllabic word (with the same syllable) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes, I know this isn't part of their system, but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that I could learn some additional words on my own.  (Sometimes you just don't want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers, for example...)But probably the biggest criticism is that this program is no substitute for classroom participation.  (Yes, I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for, but I wasn't interested in paying any more...)My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system, and we would compare experiences.  One thing I noticed is that the ""putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them"" part of Rosetta Stone, was one of the weaker sections.  She, on the other hand, got many opportunities to practice.  Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall, if classroom Italian really isn't an option for you, because you don't have the time or you just don't like classrooms, AND you have a lot of money to spend, then I'd say this is a good deal.  (If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system.)But, if you are a starving student, then you're better off looking for other books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended, but with reservations.",4,"Nice system, but way too expensive.",1340150400,"06 20, 2012","Clothing,Shoes,Jewelry"

Never was able to get past the bare basics in high school language classes (German) and, despite the fact that both my parents were born and raised in Italy, I've never been able to get much traction in Italian either.The Rosetta Stone software, however, is making a difference. No, I can't say that after using the software for a week that I'm fluent in Italian, but I am making progress. It's a very comfortable way to learn the language, especially since it's self-paced and offers tools (the headset/microphone) to help out with pronunciation, a particular stumbling block for me. Since I'm so slow at picking up a language (and self-conscious about it), I'm finding this type of robust, immersive self-study to be far more effective than classroom learning.A minor nit to pick -- I wish the headset quality was a bit better since it's such an important tool in the process. It's adequate, but given the price tag for the product, better sound quality and usage comfort would be welcomed.This is only Level 1 Italian, so the language skills taught are just the basics. Think of it as a way to get your feet wet with a new language. If you're serious about becoming fluent in Italian or looking for more than just the ability to ""try on"" a new language, then you'll want to get the advanced versions (unfortunately, at a much higher cost).It is a very fun way to learn a language.

It immediately asked if I wanted to update after I installed.  It was about a 4 MB update and downloaded/installed quickly.  Need admin privileges to install software.  Total install time with level 1 language pack was maybe 20 minutes or less (there is a lot of data copied to the PC).Launching the software was straightforward and launching into the first lesson was easy.  The only issue I had was getting the included microphone/headset to work right.  It kept telling me to say ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5"" into the microphone, but it kept saying it couldn't configure the microphone.  I finally made some random noise into the mic and it worked fine.  In the lessons the mic worked fine.In the first lesson it was obvious what needed to be done.  I was slightly disappointed that the headset headphones did not play the audio, and instead the computer speakers played the audio, so why do I need a headset for just the microphone?  Oh well, no big deal, just different.I did the first lesson with my 5 year old son, and he enjoyed it a great deal too.  He quickly picked up what he needed to do for each lesson, but as a downside many of the lessons show only four pictures, so you can just start clicking on boxes until you get it right (an issue for my son).One thing I appreciated is the first lesson had absolutely no English.  It was only images and Italian words and speaking.  This is a better way to learn to make the association of the foreign word to the object instead of translating it in your head through your native tongue first.Maybe being level 1 it is easier on me, but I found I could be pretty far off in pronunciation and it would still accept my spoken words.  However, it is still nice to have some feedback if what your saying is close to correct, and this software provides that.I think this software is excellent, but the price of entry is high.  However, how much would it cost to take a foreign language class?  The textbook would probably cost at least 1/3rd what this software would cost.  So given the high price, I still think this is a good buy if you are a good solo learner.

Activation required 2 tries, but it appears the code is only valid for 3 months so I suspect online access may be terminated after 3 months but the software should still continue to work.The pace starts off slow, but within the early portion of Unit 1, the vocabulary starts to pick up rather quickly. Since I am not a language expert, I had a hard time keeping up initially because different tenses of words, or the plural, were thrown in. Rosetta Stone relies on photographs to help you out, which is quite useful but I could not get a good grasp of the language to actually use it in normal speech. Once you start getting used to the phrases, the software begins to kick it up by throwing in more words. Unfortunately, like other users, the phrases are too simple for use in everyday conversation.The Level 1 kit includes a USB headset with a microphone to allow you to speak the phrases using the built-in speech recognition. This helps with pronunciation, although I found that it will disable my main audio and I have to switch back and forth. This isn't a big deal for most people, and there's no easy workaround.The box advertises that many Government agencies use Rosetta Stone, like the US Army and State Department. There certainly is value in the Rosetta Stone software helping Soldiers or agents learn a foreign language in the shortest time possible, but I felt it should focus on more useful phrases. 45 minutes of repeating various forms of ""Boys eating"", or ""girls running"" are not phrases that have much tactical value when you're visiting or operating in a different country.Overall: 4/5 stars",4,"Easy to use, but the phrases need to be more useful",1299196800,"03 4, 2011","Clothing,Shoes,Jewelry"
A20FK68BUB1IVA,1617160377,Happy Reader,"[0, 1]","I was prepared to be disappointed with Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1, the first Rosetta Stone I've tried.  It was the voice recognition I was leery of. Though I've studied two languages through classes, I have no aptitude for speaking languages at all. The languages I'm most familiar with are the Teutonic/Germanic gutteral sounding languages; I have such problems with the romance languages. I married into a Portuguese-American family and they still howl with laughter when, after 21 years, I attempt the language.In addition, I've broken my ear drums a couple times, and have suffered loss of hearing as a result (compounded, could be, by age!).I am very happy to say that I have had no problem hearing or understanding the Rosetta program.  The included headphone/microphone combo fits comfortably and I forget it's on while going through a lesson. In addition, I've only had a couple times where I had to repeat a phrase because it was so off-base the voice recognition program didn't think it would pass as Italian. Now, granted, this may be because the bar is set really low for how authentically I speak Italian; but I would think that with a program teaching Italian as a second language, it would have to be. For most people, it isn't teaching you how to pass as Italian, it's teaching you how to pass IN Italian. And, if the voice recognition program was too fussy, I would get discouraged and just throw it away.Lessons start out with pronunciation, one syllable at a time, spoken and written.  Then vocabulary, spoken and written. Then phrases.  Total immersion, everything is shown on the screen in Italian and spoken in the program in Italian. Occasionally, you have to type in the answer to a question, rather than say the answer.  Everything is accompanied by photos. So your learning is reinforced in three ways:  you hear the phrase spoken, you see the phrase written, and you see a photo illustrating each phrase (a boy running, boys running).  In later lessons you dive into conversations with full sentences.Your Main Menu shows you which lessons you've completed. Based on that, you can access Rosetta Studio, which is practice with real people. Your main menu will tell you if any Rosetta Studio sessions are available at any point in time. You schedule a session and you and other students take part in a session lead by a native Italian speaker.You get a two-disc CD set for additional practice when you're not on the computer. I have used mine in the car, only occasionally feeling silly for ""talking to myself"". There's no voice recognition, of course. You are only repeating what is said on the CD.  The CD is divided into the same chapters as in the computer program, and each chapter starts with pronunciation, then vocabulary and phrases. Good reinforcement, though, I have to concentrate so hard on what is being said on the CD, that it's a little distracting for driving.If you have an iPhone or another iTouch device, you can download a mini-version of the computer program, including photos. I haven't tried that as my phone is a dinosaur.Included with your program is three months access to Rosetta World OnLine. I haven't tried this yet. From what I understand, after you've completed each chapter on the computer program, you are told how many games, stories and activities are available to you on the OnLine center. You can play individual games, or games with other players (learners) logged in, or with a native Italian speaker. Unfortunately, Rosetta World OnLine is only available 8am - 8 pm for me in Pacific Standard Time zone.  Many times I've sat down at the computer after the kids are in bed, and then it's too late.  If you're in the Eastern U.S., it's available from 11 am to 11 pm. After the three month introductory offer is over, you pay a fee, but I actually can't find what the fee will be.Incidentally, Rosetta Stone offers a six-month unconditional money-back gurantee, but according to their website, you have to order it direct from Rosetta Stone. I only checked the price for Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 and as of writing this review, the price is the same as the price on amazon.I am using this program on a PC XP with no problems.",5,Voice Recognition Really Works!,1318464000,"10 13, 2011","Clothing,Shoes,Jewelry"

A2VH0UT5EQFB6P,1617160377,Loveguitar,"[3, 3]","I've had the opportunity to review several Rosetta Stone language software programs and have found them all to be quite good.  They all seem to follow the same basic structure which I find to be very helpful in acquiring language skills, and in this case, the basics of Italian language.  I've always wanted to know more about the Italian language but am not motivated to try and become fluent.  Level One for me, is just right.  However, if you are wanting to learn Italian in depth please don't just purchase Level One since it only takes you through some basic elementary language skills.No English is spoken, only Italian and I'm given a lot of visual selections from which to choose the action that represents what I'm hearing in Italian.  I seem to do fairly well having both audio AND a visual component to learning a new language.  Also, I like being able to speak my new Italian words into the included microphone and have the program correct my speech mistakes.  I haven't tried the 3 month on-line service where you can speak with a native speaker (tutor), maybe I would if I were trying to learn the language on a deeper level, but for me I'm happy with just the program itself.  After the 3 months are over you have to pay a fee and I don't like paying fees.I feel fairly confident that anyone who applies themselves regularly to any Rosetta Stone language program will learn a lot of the language being studied.  I find it to be a very natural way to learn a language.  Of course it would be best to be totally immersed in the Italian culture to learn it, but for those of us who don't have that option I think Rosetta Stone does a good job as a cultural immersion substitute.",4,Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1,1303171200,"04 19, 2011","Clothing,Shoes,Jewelry"
A18S2VGUH9SCV5,1617160377,Margaux Paschke,"[37, 41]","I wanted a refresher course in Italian so I ordered this Rosetta Stone Italiano - Level 1.  This package is certainly unlike any other language learning program I have run across and even with brief usage, has yielded great results.  Although I have no major complaints with the program itself, the price factor did influence my rating.If you have issues with installing the software, I would check to make sure your pc has the latest version of software installed.  For example, Windows XP requires Service Pack 3 for this language software to work properly and Vista needs SP2.  It is easy enough to download the latest service pack with Windows but I hear mac users have more problems.  If you have an older pc, you really need to check the hardware requirements.  Also note that you must have broadband service to access all the features.The box includes a quick start booklet, installation cds, software cds, headset, user agreement booklet, keyboard stickers to convert for Italian usage and online services.  The quick start guide is important to read first and provides support online or by telephone (called about getting it onto my iPhone and received US based help without going through a phone maze).  The software installed easily on Windows 7 as did the included headset via usb port.  The global end user license agreement booklet was printed in microscopic print so I have my fingers crossed it is the usual stuff since I could not find a magnifying glass to read it. The stickers to place over the keyboard to convert it for Italian usage might prove problematic.  I had an extra keyboard that I placed the stickers on and could switch to when using this software.  I don't know if you would want this on your keyboard all the time and peeling it on and off does not seem ideal.  I think you could get away without using the stickers.This software helps with pronunciation (the headset has a microphone), builds vocabulary and phrases, and teaches simple conversation.  The software has 4 lessons in each unit covering: basics (unit 1), greetings and introduction (unit 2), work and school (unit 3) and shopping (unit 4).  Rosetta Stone advertises a learning application for your iPhone or iPod Touch but an account with Rosetta Stone's online services is required. Although the box states it includes free online features, they are free for three months only.  There is a $25 monthly fee  or a $149 fee for 15 months for online services after the trial period.  The 3 month trial starts the moment you activate your online account and you must be at least 13 to create an account.  I strongly suggest you use the software only and then use the online services to get the most out of this software.  The online services are great and allow you to access online tutors, games, and an online community to practice your Italian.  I really liked the options provided online but wished I had activated the free trial after I had gone through the lessons to get more out of it.  It's hard to converse or play simple games when you are just starting to learn Italian.Overall, this is a great tool to learn Italian if you can afford the hefty price tag.  For the same price you might be able to audit an Italian course at a local school but this software is more convenient and provides more personalized service.  Using this language software in tandem with its online services is almost as good as a private tutor at a lower cost.  I don't think I will continue with the online services given this is just a hobby for me but if you urgently needed to learn Italian, this would be worth the price.  I consider having friendly customer service available by phone a big plus.",4,a great way to learn italian if you can afford it,1298419200,"02 23, 2011","Clothing,Shoes,Jewelry"

However, Rosetta Stone made it easy and fun to learn very basic Italian.

A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,1617160377,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[9, 10]","ROSETTA STONE is famous for teaching language the way little children learn language...naturally, quickly, without studying verb declention charts, memorizing vocabulary lists, or navagating grammatical oddities. However, there is an obvious problem with this philosophy that ROSETTA STONE has based their teaching method upon. The people who buy and learn from ROSETTA STONE are NOT 3-5 year old children. Any Linguist will tell you, children are hard wired to learn grammer, and to speak perfectly their native language. As we age, the ability to speak certain sounds disappears, and the ability to learn certain types of grammer also disappears. Once a child is past that stage of absorbing grammerical rules naturally, or pronouncing certain native sounds, the door shuts. You can still learn, but not perfectly. This is why a russian who learns english, will NEVER understand exactly how to use definative articles. Also, this is why Russian constanant clusters are impossible to pronounce for English speakers. There are almost NO exceptions to this, except for language savants i suppose.However, as far as learning language in a natural way, on your own, ROSETTA STONE is the best you can do. As anyone knows who's studied foreign languages in high school or college, you start with learning to pronounce the alphabet. Then, you learn the most common words, along with the way basic verbs (TO BE, TO HAVE, TO KNOW, etc) are conjugated, how the nouns and adjectives interact, etc. ROSETTA STONE turns that learning process on its head, and the center of its do-it-yourself language class, is the SPEACH RECOGNITION system. The RS Kit comes with alphabet letters for your computer keyboard (in case your target language has a different alphabet, than the English alphabet), and the computer files, plus four CDs to pracitice pronounciation when away from the computer. Also, the buyer recieves in the box, this headset w/microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer.(plus a few simple instructions to get started.) Unlike the oldest voice recognition programs from a decade ago, this headset just sets the volumn level, and you are ready to go. Instead of learning to pronounce the alphabet, you just learn to speak the first words a baby might speak...""cat, run, read, boy, girl, hello, 1,2,3,4,5,6"", stuff like that. Rosetta Stone assumes you will learn the pronounciation rules automatically, ""BY EAR"". First, not everybody CAN learn strickly by ear. Some musicians can hear a song, and they KNOW every chord they heard, and the notes, and can reproduce them instantly, because they can PLAY MUSIC BY EAR. Other musicians need to learn what notes belong where on the instrument, and they need sheet music, and chord theory. WHY? Because some people are more right brain, others more left brain...maybe some people HEAR better, and others analyse better. So, if you are trying to pronounce the Italian word ""ZIA"" (Aunt), you will never GUESS it should sound like TSEE-ah. When English speakers see a ""Z"", they will not pronouce ""TS"", as in German, Russian, Italian, etc. SINCE ROSETTA STONE DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT THE ITALIAN ""Z"" OUGHT TO SOUND LIKE, you need to guess. THis is when the ROSETTA STONE voice recognition just doesnt work. You might hear TSEE-a, but if you see ""ZIA"", your brain will think it's hearing what it's used to hearing--""ZEE-ah"", and that's what you will say. AND, the voice recognistion WONT recognise the correct pronounciation. Likewise, Italian has other sounds not at all like English, and unless you have some kind of heads up on how each letter SHOULD sound, you may never get close to the correct sound. I have a good ear. But i couldn't hear that Italian has a more dental sounding ""D"" than english. I didnt know the other oddities associated with pronouncing the Italian language. At times, I would click on LANGUAGE LAB, where you get directed to a page that SLOWS DOWN the pronounciation of the word, as well as showing you the voice print, and how the native speaker's voice rises and falls naturally, during the pronounciation of the word. (Apparently for correct stress.) If you are 50% or less away from getting it right, you see a brown cirle that tells you about how close you are, to correct pronounciation. (Plus the system records your attempt at pronouncing the word, so you can compair what you are saying, to that of a native speaker.) If your circle turns green, you are 80% or closer to perfect pronounciation. HOWEVER, this system DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. Once, i tried to pronounce ARRIVIDERCI for 15 minutes. I was UPSET, then angry, then bored, and finally, dejected. Frustration kills motivation, and I think that's why problems with the voice recognition bothers so many people. IF i knew what was wrong with my pronounciation, at least i could TRY to figure out how to say it. I think this happens to EVERYBODY who uses Rosetta Stone at some point. The computer program doesnt say ""The Italian 'G' is PRONOUNCED HARDER THAN ENGLISH 'G'."" Instead, you are suppose to just KNOW this.  Sometimes, i just believe the voice recognition is just not able to read normal variations in pronounciation correctly. For example, ROSETTA STONE wants you to roll your R's. But, very few people even in Italy can actually make that sound. So then the voice recognistion hears the lack of rolling R's as a mistake in pronounciation. The computer program considers these mistakes as WRONG on your part, and at times the mistakes start to stack up. IF you dont get thru a lesson with a good score, you'll need to repeat the lesson, and also repeat the offending word. (the program tracks a LOT of parameters, including how long its been since you have taken a lesson. Too long, and RS makes you review things before you can start the lessons again. But that's good.) All I can say, is when I could not pronounce a certain word, i almost never knew why. Even tho ROSETTA STONE gives you 4 CDs for pronounciation practice, if you've an inability to say a certain word, you might not ever speak it correctly.My other problem, was that there is NOTHING in the kit, that explains GRAMMER the way you learnt grammer in school. Sometimes, those photos that go with the spoken or written exercise, dont get the idea across very well. THE ONLY SOLLUTION, is to buy some kind of cheap TEACH YOURSELF ITALIAN paperback book, that covers basics of grammer, pronounciation, vocabulary, and all the other holes in the learning of the language, that ROSETTA STONES leaves untouced. AMAZON.COM sells a pretty good book, very cheap, that would help anyone using their ROSETTA STONE class immensely. ""ITALIAN MADE SIMPLE"" by Cristina Mazzoni, for around $8 new. I bought that book, and only then, were the grammer lessons beginning to make sense. ALSO, this book spends time in the beginning, to teach the differences between the way OUR alphabet is pronounced, and the way the Italian Alphabet is pronounced. You NEED to get a book like this, so you understand italian grammer, and have a little bit of an Italian dictionary as well.There are a few other problems with ROSETTA STONE. Everybody says ""DONT SIGN UP FOR LANGUAGE LAB, UNTIL YOU GET THRU THE LANGUAGE BASICS"". Because, depending on how fast, or slow, you are motivated to move thru the lessons, those 3 months of FREE LANGUAGE LAB go by really fast. WAIT TO SIGN UP! ALSO, its good to know that you cant just sign up for language lab a day or two before you want to use it. THERE IS A TWO WEEK WAIT, to have a lesson. Besides the speach recognition problem, and the lack of a good text book so you can learn grammer, pronounciation and vocabulary the way adults learn language, everything about ROSETTA STONE's classes are LOTS OF FUN. Really. They have games that help you keep those new words constantly in your mind. There are stories that help with reading, that are clued into your number of finished lessons. ITALIAN LEVEL ONE, for example, is divided into UNIT ONE, language basics, UNIT TWO, Greetings, UNIT THREE, Work and school, UNIT FOUR, shopping. By the time you finish that much of the course, you should be able to get around Italy, and make basic conversation. I would guess your proficiency level might be FIRST YEAR COLLEGE ITALIAN, or two years of high school italian, or 1-2 Italian grandparents. ROSETTA STONE is very visually interesting, and will keep you motivated once you get past that first unit (language basics), so long as you dont have major problems being understood by the voice recognition software. I wish i had waited for the langauge lab, because i'm SURE that would have helped. However, if you don't use it as much as you want after the first 3 months, its only $25 a month, for more time with those online tutors. All things considered, VOICE RECOGNITION really DOES work remarkably well. I'm sure most of the problems people have, come from their inablity to pronouce certain sounds specific to their target language, rather than the program's inability to understand your voice. If you are speaking the language correctly, I would guess anywhere from 96-99% of the time, ROSETTA STONE understands EXACTLY what you say. If some word (like my problem with ARRIVIDERCI) comes up, you can easily skip the word. There is NO OTHER SELF TAUGHT LANGUAGE CLASS that can perfect your speach, increase your vocabulary, and engage you in an ""immersion"" type language adventure, like ROSETTA STONE can.  NO OTHER SYSTEM has the native speaker 1 on 1 language lab. The only REAL problem is if you learn on your own, its hard to keep your motivation for learning high. You'll need discipline and some kind of reward, ie, a trip to Italy if you finish LEVEL 1? (Or maybe just a FELLINI film. Whatever rocks your boat.) Good luck with your language adventure, and ARRIVIDERCI!",5,The EXASPERATION of SPEACH RECOGNITION,1309305600,"06 29, 2011","Clothing,Shoes,Jewelry"

You might not be able to tell from the picture, but there are shin-guard type pieces for the legs, and gauntlets on the sleeves.  Nice touch.  It is a little thin overall.  You'll definitely want to put something underneath if you're in a colder climate.  My only disappointment is that the back of the torso is entirely black.

The pants were a little longer, but with shoes, he fit it, no problem. (He is ""average"" height and weight, for a 2.5 year old, according to docs.)  If your child is ""meaty"" at all like mine is on top, I would suggest getting the larger size.After reading the other reviews about how flimsy this costume was, I didn't let my kiddo wear it until the actual day of Halloween. He ran around a lot but it didn't tear at all. I think it has a couple more good uses in it.If you are hoping to buy a costume that will last and will allow your child to play in it at home, I don't think this is the one. They have the $50 one that looks a lot more sturdier. But if it's just for this Halloween and maybe next year for the kiddo next door, then by all means, get this one!!!

The laser lines are only seen when you come up about 10 feet from the bike, It's just there for the cool factor I believe. People riding next to you or a few feet behind can see the red laser lines very well.

The mount seemed sturdy enough. Bounced bike up and down several times to see if it would slip it didn't. You can also see the LED lights from the side very well, witch I think is important.  I do not know the run time since I only had one ride so far, but I assume it will be normal for LED lights.

This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement. This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer.

Far better and more versatile than weights, these band are fun and create exercises that require small muscle stabilization far better then weight machines.For the price you could do far worse.  If you're one of those folks in a DVD program, start to improvise, do what feels good.  Yes I have push up bars, I use them for handstand practice, really good stuff.  Get them and enjoy.  If you're a serious pump monkey, keep these around for vacations or while watching tv.I have since purchased some of the new heavier pull bands, this product is now an exercise stable for a gymnastics coach.  The nature of them makes them better than free weights and the versatility of exercises is amazing.  I have a pull up bar identical to the one Black Mountain sells, you can do some really cool stuff, limited only by strength and imagination.As an aside, the Black Mountain guys are really nice and answer all questions.

But now that they changed to standard carabineers instead, I decided to buy a second set, which I use more regularly. Also I recommend getting the new extra strength orange and purple bands, sold separately. I would say the only drawback may be is that the bands, all bands not just the two mentioned, are a little short for some people, and probably best suited for people in the 5'4"" to 5'9"" range. I'm not saying people below and above that range shouldn't get a set. Let me just make it clear the height range I gave is not a concrete standard. It's just an opinion as to how I feel. I'm 5'11"" and I'm very careful how I use my bands. Black Mountain is a very good company with awesome customer service, and they're always working on improving their products. For the price and some common sense usage it's tough to find a better basic set than this. My previous swivel end set is a souvenir I keep in my closet. I hope they come out with a new set the has all 7 bands, 2 ankle straps instead of just 1, 2 sets of handles that are bigger than what they have now, a door anchor with a cushioned liner, and a really nice bag to put it in.

I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a ""Fresh and Fruity"" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled ""I Scream for Quick Pops!"", ""Bake Shop"", and  ""Coco Loco"". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on ""Tips"" and ""Techniques"" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops. The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits, but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible. Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well. I've substituted it with no ill effect. On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults. There are flavors like ""Cookie Dough"", ""That's a S'more"", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly. All 9 recipes in ""Bake Shop"" are inspired by cake and cookie recipes.As a resource for light, fresh-tasting fruit pop recipes, ""Zoku Quick Pops"" is very limited. Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients. The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor. The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors. Mango and orange together make a terrific pop. The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes. Tips and techniques are also useful.

The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old.

It gives you instructions on how to assemble cakes on stands, pillars or stacked construction.  It also contains recipes for basic scratch cakes in white, yellow, chocolate, strawberry, and banana.  It also has the recipes for standard Wilton Icings, fillings, glazes, fondant (not the tasty marshmallow kind), color flow, gum paste, and candy clay.  There are tips for baking, leveling, torting, filling and icing the cakes.  It also gives some instruction on how to cover a cake with fondant.  There are suggestions for transporting tiered cakes, calculating servings per cake and cutting guides.  The book also includes patterns and instructions for various decorations.  As with all Wilton books, the last few pages detail products you can buy from them to duplicate all the designs in the book.  The problem is that some of these items don't seem to be available on their web site any more.  The book was first published in 2005.  Still, it's a great idea book and I'm sure you can find acceptable substitutes for a lot of the items.  The book contains ideas for cakes that could be served at weddings, anniversaries, and showers.Also, I'm not sure if it's offered everywhere, but I'm currently enrolled in a class taught by a Wilton Instructor called ""Tall Cakes"".  It is taught in two sessions.  The first class is a demonstration by the instructor on how to put together a tiered cake.  The second class is where we bring in our own cakes and learn how to stack or pillar them.  It's less expensive than the other classes, no kit is required and the items needed are this book, one six-inch and one ten-inch layer cake, the plate/pillars, and our decorations.

People, co-workers, family members, friends will be dazzled and amazed -- and so will YOU.  This lesson book is extremely valuable. It cannot be purchased from Wilton (which is a real crying shame).

Having bakes/cooked since the age of 9, I really didn't feel it was necessary but boy was I surprised. I learned more in my first class than I had in years of teaching. Wilton honestly needs to sell these lesson plans.  Not only will receive money from the classes, but they will also make money from the books.  Why would a company prefer their customers buy their books from someone else??? I've not figured that out.  Getting back to this lesson book...you will be extremely, extremely happy.

Since all you see on the cover is some ""clown"" cupcakes using the silly-feet baking cups (which I also purchased) I was expecting more uses of the silly-feet (I counted five), but it really covers whimsical cupcakes of all sorts, many of which would be suitable to make with children (easy to make).It's really just an idea book and a catalog of Wilton products and what you can do with them. There is a helpful section called ""The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate"", and there are about six pages of recipes. Most cupcake instructions are from 1/8 to 1/2 page long, right next to a big, clear picture.After getting over the ""it wasn't what I expected"" part of receiving this book, and seeing that my boyfriend seems rather enthusiastic about making really whimsical cupcakes and loves the silly-feet, I like this book more and more. Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas. If you are familiar with the typical adverbook that Wilton puts out, you shouldn't find any surprises here, and some of the recipes, which are a blend of from-a-mix and from-scratch, for the most part look very tempting.There are six pages of really cute Halloween cupcakes, including a vampire in a coffin, and some skeletons/ghosts/tombstones.",4,Typical Wilton adverbook,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",Home and Kitchen

AZKRFNQ8EFO4T,9742356831,Mike Williams,"[4, 4]","I have two things in mind when I make a Thai curry: 1) I want it to taste good and 2) I want whomever I'm making it for to feel like it's fairly authentic. Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.A few things I've learned using their curry pastes over the years:1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal. It's very easy to adjust the amount of paste used, and with practice you'll learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.2) The packaging doesn't mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with ""lite"" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor.

I didn't get hungry until at least three hours later (and for me that is actually pretty good, I'm always hungry).The main flavor of this bar was the peanut butter. The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me.  It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip.  The bar was chewy, but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar.  It was sweet, and that's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup, honey, evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips.  Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams.  So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good.  There's whole oats, rice flour, and other pronounceable ingredients throughout.  And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it's even somewhat nutritional for you.  But there are a lot of allergens here as well, as is obvious by the peanut butter flavor.  And another thing of note is that this bar packs a walloping 240 calories.  So use it as a meal replacement or for during vigorous exercise as opposed to a snack.  It would definitely be a good bar for a hiking trip.I liked it and will probably consider it again for breakfast.

A3GT2EWQSO45ZG,B00002243X,DeusEx,"[19, 19]","I absolutley love Amazon!!!  For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a ""jump"" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The ""booster car"" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.The technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a ""dead"" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the ""dead"" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!

A3MQAQT8C6D1I7,B00002243Z,AverageReviewer,"[19, 21]","All other jumper cables are not real jumper cables.  THESE are jumper cables.  Let me explain.When you're in a bind on some dark night in some parking lot somewhere and your battery is dead, you need to get out of there pronto.In times like that, it's much easier to get a jump if YOU own a set of jumper cables.  It's double good if those jumper cables are long so that they can easily reach the battery of a good samaritan.  Now, according to electrical theory in order for DC current to flow across long distances, you need thicker cable.That's where these cables come in, they're long at 25' and thick at 2gauge.That's what these cables provide, maximum length at near maximum gauge cable.  And yes, your jumper cables SHOULD cost close to as much as your spare tire because that's what you need --- just look up the cost of copper on the market (that stuff is expensive).Yes, you can buy a $17 set of 10 foot, 18 gauge cables out there but if they can't reach between cars or if they can't carry enough power to start your car, you might as well have been lugging a brick in your trunk all those years and you might as well have enjoyed a good lunch with the $17 for all the false confidence it gave you.  I'm serious, buy an extension cord for $5 and you get as much jumping potential as many of the so called 'jumper' cables on the market --- there should be laws against marketing products that cannot jump start a car.  Worse, having no cables or less-than-worthless cables means that a criminal might reach you before you can get a jump and make your getaway.At the end of the day, you want a 25' or 20' cable, so you better be looking at 2gauge or 4 gauge cable - no compromises there.  You can go to 6gauge if you're working your way down to 16' cables.  But, the reality is that you always need a few extra feet when trying to jump start someone's car parked in some tight parking space --- so you're back to the 25' and 2 gauge.Pros- I know I can jump start a Semi with these (more importantly, I can get a jump from a Semi - Truck drivers are the good guys btw)- Extra long at 25'- Parrot clamp are strong, but an average guy can open them with one hand- Copper inserts in the parrot clamps is nice- Clamps are rated at 500amps- they're friggin heavy at near 14lbs, yes that's a pro!  that means there's 14 POUNDS of Copper in there and that's what allows the current to flow as freely as the Amazon river (no pun intended). It's huge.Cons- I do have an issue that the copper cable is not attached to the copper inserts in the clamps, it screws into the metal clamp rather than into the copper insert.  I don't know if that's a mistake or not.  I'm thinking about doing a bit of retrofitting.  I'm sure it's more than enough the way it is.Overall, these are as close an approximation to the kind of jumper cables that my dad had when I was growing up.  He custom made his -- he's old school.Anyway, if you're going to carry jumper cables, and you should --- don't muck around -- spend the dough, get these --- they'll last a lifetime and will not let you down.Advice, after you get a jump don't waste time rolling these things up in some dark parking lot -- just toss the heavy mangled mess into your trunk and get home.  There's always time the next day to roll these monsters back up and get them ready for the next wild adventure you might have.",5,Jumper Cables - The Real Deal,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",Automotive

A3GT2EWQSO45ZG,B00002243Z,DeusEx,"[20, 21]","So these aren't the best cables you can buy.  For that you'll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY!  Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost!  So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use, I'd say these are gonna work for you.(Update: After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car, they don't really seem that much thicker...  That's said they are MUCH heavier!  The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I'm guessing that's why the thickness isn't much more...)What I like:--Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup.  Why?  Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides.  Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you.--Heft - these cables are no joke.  It's a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow.  When trying to start a 5.7L V8, that's kinda important.--Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand.  But their hardly weak, they'll clamp solid and stay put!(Update: If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these, Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $150.  I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good.)What I don't like:--Stiffness - They're not as flexible as I was hoping.  But about as flexible as I expected.  True welding cable in 2ga is about $3 per foot and per cable.  That's why the best jumper cables cost $200+.  Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty.--Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable doesn't go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws.  Instead.  It's screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body.  Still fine I'm sure.So why buy these cables aren't they overkill?  I've had this argument with people before: ""My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine.""  Well I will attempt to addess this.  As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases.  In other words 2ga has more (perhaps 50-100% more) conductor than 4ga.  This doesn't automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely.  For those that aren't aware (and I'm not an electrical engineer here), resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts.  Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together.  Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size.  Ambient temperature, conductor, line distance, voltage, and amperage.  Ambient temp we have no control over.  Hot is bad so just assume the worst.  This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing.  Conductor of these is copper so that's good.  You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor.  Distance and voltage.  One of these cable's strengths also happens to be a weakness.  Total run length for this circut is 50'.  Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop.  12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance.  So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this.  Amperage is also a big consideration.  The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate.  Basically on a small wire, a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen. 1) the wire will melt and/or catch on fire.  2) The load your trying to power won't work.  And make no mistake, starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy!  So bringing it all together.  Large load, low voltage (that we don't want to make in lower), and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find.  Addressing the orignal question and statment.  6' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine.  But if you want or need the extra length, you need to consider heavy gauge cables.  That said I've personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you?  So these will run you close to $100 shipped...do you actaully need them?  I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25' booster cables.  Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this.  The 4ga will do you fine at the 25' length for engines up to 5-liters or so (and honestly probably up to about 6L as well.)  Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment.  Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected.  Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag.  I have the Arsenal #5888 cable organizer and it works great for this.

This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness.

I have a dark grey/charcoal colored interior that is patterned and almost feels 'sticky' to the touch for lack of a water word.  Using a microfiber cloth didn't really clean up the dust too well and another duster I picked up here works ok on the radio console and steering wheel but not on the dash itself.Despite a few negative reviews here I decided to give it a go after a recent price drop.  Picked this up for $4.63 when I figured I didn't have much to lose.Put it out on the porch for two days on a stack of newspapers as was suggested.  After that I gave it a bunch of really good shakes and then ran my fingers thru the fibers a few times trying to get out any of the lose ones.  That seemed to do the trick because I haven't had any issues with stray red fibers all over the place or the pad falling apart as I've read in previous reviews.Shortly after I went out to the car and cleaned the outside and the inside.  Shook it out a bunch and it seemed to work great on the dash which has been a PITA since I bought the car.  Afterwards I brought it inside and used it to dust my entire first floor of my house.  This included behind my tv and entertainment center, on top of my refrigerator and all those other places normally buried in dust.  Worked like a charm, sucked it all up and didn't let go.So I'd have to say this, just like it big brother, the Original, works like a charm.

However, on first use it did a lot more for us than expected. The first time it rained after I used RainX was on a cross-country trip last week, and amazingly it almost completely eliminated the need to use windshield wipes even during downpours. Water drops still land on the windshield, but immediately rolls off whenever the car is moving, leaving a very clear view through the windshield - much clearer than even with wipers on high. For those who have flown small planes, the effect is much the same, and why such planes don't even have wipers. (At air speeds, wind pushes raindrops off the windshield very nicely all by itself.)The only time we needed to use the wipers in several days of rain and snow driving was when passing trucks, as those covered the windshield with clouds of tiny droplets that were hard to see through.A week later, I'm noticing the windshield no longer clears itself at speeds under 40 MPH, so it may be due for another treatment, but still stays nicely clear at highway speeds, and is very easy to clear at lower speeds with a single pass of the wipers.",5,Surprisingly effective!,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",Automotive

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000H00VBQ,Z Hayes,"[12, 12]","I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the ""cozy"" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.",5,I purchased the series via streaming and loved it!,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",Amazon Instant Video

A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B000H4YNM0,J. Hill,"[0, 0]","Out of all the new comedies that have come out in the last ten years, Sunny is as the top of my list.  You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.

At things that aren't supposed to be funny, but as any serious fan of comedy knows, those can be the best laughs. I walked away feeling lighter and happier. If that ain't comedic success, what is?IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger, Irish, and ran a bar in South Philly. These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely, and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque...but they go places even LD won't. The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion; I howled at some moments. These guys have done what so many guys want to do: make a show about how funny they are. Except, these guys really are funny. Sometimes. But hey, no one's always hittin' homers, even on comedy 'roids, so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together. There's a lot to be said for working with old friends, if they have talent: the camaraderie and timing here are born of many years of drinking and laughing and thinking and falling down, no doubt. And these three guys are each pretty dang funny, each in his own fashion.DeVito is ok but I liked the first season best for its rawness. Still, as the later shows get a little more polished it's often in good ways.If you don't like drinking, if you insist on PC language from your friends and neighbors, and if you are in general just plain uptight about people living and thinking the way you want them to, look elsewhere. But If you enjoy tying one on and laughing your butt off at the endlessly silly idiocy that accompanies being alive in America these days, you may just find Always Sunny to be almost always funny.",5,It's Very Often Funny In Philly: occasionally hilarious in all the best wrong ways,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",Amazon Instant Video

Not since Arrested Development has a sitcom been this truly hysterical and quick paced that you don't know what to expect next.  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, originally premiering on the FX network in 2005, revolves around four friends: Charlie (Charlie Day), Mac (Rob McElhenney), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), and his sister Dee (Kaitlin Olson); all of whom own and run an Irish bar in downtown Philadelphia.  They get into all kinds of crazy hijinks through misunderstandings and just plain bad judgement, ranging from being mistaken as a gay bar to Charlie lying about having cancer.  Yes, there's nothing really wholly original about the show's premise, but it remains hysterically funny throughout.

A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000HAB4NK,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[12, 14]","For sheer intensity and plot topsy-turvies, no other show comes close to 24. You'd think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer's assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.There's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey's Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack's estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!",5,Possibly the best 24 yet,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",Amazon Instant Video
A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B000HAB4NK,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[15, 17]","Revel in his awesomeness!!! For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of ""prisoner's rights"" and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O'Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that's happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it's still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends. And the ending of the final episode of the season... that scream you heard in the whole of the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico... that was me.

It's fast-paced, big-budgeted, over-the-top (sometimes WAAAAAAAY over-the-top), and mostly clever. But I don't think ANY of the previous seasons (or the lame season 6) can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.Yes this season follows the same (tired) gimick of everything happening in real-time, but what set this season apart for me was it's more focusd plot-line. Several of lead character Jack Bauer's friends are killed or attacked and he's out to find out who and get revenge. Ok, sometimes the overall story arch DOES get side-tracked to the typical (terrorists trying to release poisonous gas), and sometimes it's not always that interesting (CTU gets infiltrated AGAIN!). But none of these side-attractions even BEGIN to take-away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break-neck speed and crediblilty (thanks also to the believable performances of the ENTIRE cast).Like some people I try not to watch the show on TV and much prefer to wait for the DVD to come out which is why I can't recommend buying this season enough (thought why there's not subtitles on every episode is beyond me).

Even after five years, this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting.  I am glued to my seat every week, breathing only during commercial breaks.  This season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years, adding to the drama.There were a couple flaws this season.  I sure don't remember the explanation of who knew Jack was alive at the beginning of the season.  Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it.  Furthermore, we have yet more examples of lack of security at CTU.  While it does make for gripping drama, it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.My biggest complaint this season was the body count.  We lost several key characters from previous years.  While I understand the producer's desire to keep us on the edge of our seats, can't anyone from the show live happily ever after?  It honestly got to the point I dreaded seeing anyone who had been on the show before for fear they would be killed off.Still, these are minor issues with a truly wonderful show.

Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).Season 5 is probably my favorite season to date. It starts strong and doesn't let up until it's over.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they've added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn't completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some ""intense"" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.",5,Best show still in production on Broadcast TV?,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",Amazon Instant Video

Alliances are challenged, close friends are lost--all the while Jack Bauer tries to keep his sanity and find out who the real culprit is behind one of the most trying days in American history.The cast is perfect, the storyline is compelling, and the action is never ceasing.  This season had by far the most suspense as well as the most cliff hangers.  After I finished watching an episode, I usually wanted to go right to the next and watch it right away!  There is, however, a big plot hole in the season.  The fate of Evelyn Martin and her daughter was never covered, and I found that unfair; an entire episode depicted their plight, and I feel it should have been resolved, whether she was killed or left alive by Henderson.Any show that can make a person sympathize with someone while viciously rooting against them (i.e. Logan) is a stupendous show.  24 delivers all of that and more, with its best season to date.9/10",5,The Best Season So Far,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",Amazon Instant Video

AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000HAB4NK,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[9, 12]","""24"" is like Red Bull--once you've had it you're addicted. The fifth season of ""24"" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It's a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched ""Casino Royale"" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like ""24"" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven't seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode ""prequel"" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There's also a summary of the season included as well athough if you've watched the show (or are watching it now) it won't really provide anything new. Th ""100 Episode Reel"" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven't had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging.

AP3B615GM191G,B000HAB4NK,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","While Season One of 24 focused much of its attention on President David Palmer, Seasons 2-4 saw the Oval Office by and large take a back seat to the missions of Jack Bauer and CTU.  However, Season Five brings some of the attention back to the sitting U.S. President (this time Charles Logan) and ends up with a much more well-rounded storyline.For a basic (non-spoilery) plot summary, a group of Russian terrorists threaten to release canisters of nerve gas in the U.S., leading Bauer to be reprieved from his thought-to-be death in order to help stop the crisis.  As CTU begins investigating the terrorism, however, it quickly becomes clear that the terrorists are working with a high-ranking government official, and the conspiracy begins to be unraveled.To be honest, at first I was skeptical of all the focus on President Logan, as didn't like his character and wasn't sure that he could command the camera as well as his predecessor Palmer.  However, by the end of the season, Logan is easily the most enjoyable/interesting character on the show.  His acting, along with his wife, chief of staff, and head of security, really gives the show the Presidential presence it lacked since that first season.Of course, there is still more than enough of Jack Bauer and his fellow CTU agents (Audrey Rains, Bill Buchanon, Edgar Stiles, Chloe O'Brien, etc.) to go around, which means that intense drama ensues in every single episode.  The writers have an amazing way to take a character that looks like a creep (think Tony Almeida and George Mason in the early seasons) and, by the end of a few episodes, have him become a noble hero, and that tradition continues in this season as well.The only ""knock"" I have on this season is that the cliffhanger endings of each episodes aren't quite as shocking (e.g. Nina Myers doesn't appear out of nowhere).  However, I think that was more of a creative choice by the writers, as the story is actually more coherent that any season besides the first one.  Instead of seemingly changing the plot of the show with every episode, Season Five slowly crescendos until the big finale.So, fans of 24 can purchase this season with confidence knowing that they will still get their action, drama, suspense, and some great twists and turns along the way.",5,Back To Its Political Roots,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",Amazon Instant Video

And to try to throw alot at us, NCIS gets a new director, Jenny Shepard played by Lauren Holly. Now Shepard and Gibbs do have some history, since both were partners at NCIS at one time, also. To proclaim Ari's innocence, is Massade officer Ziva David. And I'm sorry, I didn't like her then. And I don't liker her now, She and pretty much all of Massad is built up like they are the only agents that are extremely tough, they're unstoppable. So Ziva and Jenny try to convince Gibbs that he's wrong, and Gibbs even makes the only logical argument against Ari's innocence. That if he were innocent, he would turn himself in. So, after much arguing, he gets Ziva to follow him. And Ziva kills Ari in Gibb's basement, And we get each persons view of how they saw Kate in this episode. Now, I would have inserted Paula Cassidy to the team after this. Since there was some obvious chemistry between her and tony, but no. We get Ziva, and she is built up like I said. As this unstoppable, lean mean killing machine. The best of the best, and I'm sorry, but she's abrasive and annoying. And I still have a hard time accepting her to the team, Gibbs magically trusts her more than any other member of the team. season three is a good season, and Ziva is the on;y reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Although season three does end with almost getting blown up, going into a coma. Waking up from that coma, and thinking it's 1991. And we get to meet Gibbs's mentor, Mike Franks. Which leads to gibbs trying to stop a terrorists attack. Only the generals won't allow it, and Gibbs ends up Quitting NCIS. All in all, season three is still awsome.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,5555991584,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","Enya, despite being a successful recording artist, doesn't have the broad appeal as other artists; one reason might be that her kind of music is not very pop station friendly while another reason could be people think they're too ""macho"" for music that she makes. But people with open minds could find there's some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively, upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine), the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album's title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10Anywhere Is: The lively single; it's actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It's also a perfect length since it's under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile, this one hooks you in then lets you go, leaving you wanting more. 9/10Pax Deorum: Another album, another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you'd hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice, almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh: There's some songs she does where it's more about the song itself rather than a poppy, catchy quality a la Only Time and this song's similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing, it's a more low-key track but it's also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one's a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it's not technically complex or fast but it's pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10China Roses: There's only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation, the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I've ever heard, this is definately my favorite song on here, plus her whole career even. 15/10Hope Has a Place: For me, any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn't do much for me. Granted, her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice, relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it's just not as memorable. 7/10Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments, it's another wordless song although it's more enjoyable than From Where I Am is, mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it's a bit more song-oriented. It's different but strangely likable. 8/10Once You Had Gold: We're getting into the album's final stretch and the problem is that with this one, it's a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya's more higher vocals (for some reason, reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition), it's another beautiful track but it's also a bit...same-y? 8/10La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once, it's another slower paced track complete with ""aahs"" for background vocals and synths but again, the album could've benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth, you'd think it was a bit more upbeat. While it's not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is, it does give the album a bit more memorable closer, especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them), I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks, it's still one of her finest outings.",4,4.5; music to dream to,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",Digital Music
A2P49WD75WHAG5,5555991584,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[62, 65]","Who knows why I initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world.  Maybe I was expecting Shepherd's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd's Eclipse.  The songs didn't leap out to me?  Well, listening to it for this review, it finally did, and I've embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent, sporting the usual instrumentals, pianos, haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals, pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park, is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another, where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life, isn't it?&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind, which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song, as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn, though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune, full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here, and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful, reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark, with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it's an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals, and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream, my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river, a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh, how I love this woman!OK, all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how's this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home, and the heart is free.&quot;  I can't decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;The third instrumental, &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot;, has some Oriental strains, with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title, a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon, set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come, seasons go type, and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark, shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it's more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song's midsection.A reminiscing night traveller's thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, where &quot;I remember all the best days/I'm on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums, Enya's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I've ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here, as it's &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.  There's more a wall of dreamy sound here--check out how many times I've mentioned this.  Repeated listenings will tell whether it'll dislodge Shepherd's Moon as my favourite Enya album.",5,Dreamy unearthly magic continues with Eire's one and only!,1059523200,"07 30, 2003",Digital Music
A3O90G1D7I5EGG,5555991584,dev1,"[1, 5]","Enya is one of a few artists whom I consider successful at creating this type of electronic atmospheric and dreamlike music. For certain, The Memory Of Trees is melodic, romantic and sensuous. Roma Ryan's lyrics, sung in  Gaelic by Enya (Athair Ar Neamh), float gently like pillow-soft white  clouds. The compositions are relaxing and harmonious (Tea House Moon),  dreamlike and filled with mystery (Once You Had Gold), and include subtle  touches of Celtic tradition (Enya's phrasing on `Hope Has A Place'). The CD  is a quiet and lush alternative to ninety-percent of the popular music on  the market today, and also a welcome substitute for the often hectic pace  of daily life. Enya's arrangement of the compositions on Memory is well  thought - the comparatively dramatic and uplifting `Anywhere Is' and `On My  Way Home' are placed so that the listener doesn't fall asleep.However,  I'm very leery when I read a dozen reviews of a particular musical release,  and all the writers rate the artist's work with five-stars. My hesitation  is not a matter of taste (listeners are free to condemn or rave about  whatever they please), but one of perspective. Is The Memory Of Trees a  musical ground breaking effort? Does it introduce a unique technique or  significantly alter a current genre of popular music? On close listening,  the electronic pseudo-symphonic music of Memory does not approach the  beauty or dynamics of an orchestra with real people playing real  instruments. Nor does Enya's multi-layering of her own voice have the same  rich sonic texture as a chorus comprised of real voices. Then again,  perhaps The Memory Of Trees (and all of Enya's work) is so provocatively  ethereal because it is surreal.",3,Have You Hugged A Tree Today?,959385600,"05 27, 2000",Digital Music
A3EJYJC25OJVKK,5555991584,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[5, 5]","Enya is one of of the most mysterious singers in music today. I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later...I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece.

Enya is not an artist who blends in with the rest and this release is, in my opinion, her best to date.There is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new age and Enya is certainly a new age artist, but she has strong writing skills and gorgeous and very unique voice that sets her apart from her peers. And if you look at what is being released these days, many groups are ripping off elements of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo songs with session singers who do an ok job of copying Enya, but don't reach the depths of beauty and passion that only Enya seems to find.What makes this a 5-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know. I know this sounds ridiculous, but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music. Al the songs are great and although this CD can be great background music, it works even better when it's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful.Many artists/fans are critical of the work that the producer brings to the table, but I am always very appreciative when the final product does not sound like it was manufactured by an assembly line, but rather reflects a balance of the artist's intent with the listener in mind.Thanks for reading and I would like to thank ALL reviewers as their opinions (even when I disagree) give me clues as to what I may like and even more importantly provide exposure to artists who I may have missed if it were not for work.

But for her to have essentially taken the crown of this genre implies a depth to her music, and this is very evident on ""The Memory of Trees"".Enya's first few albums were good, but there was something missing, something that had yet to be developed. I'm not entirely sure what that intangible ""something"" was, but she certainly found it on this one. The title track is an instrumental masterpiece featuring her trademark layered vocals (though no lyrics to speak of), and it reminds on of a clear fall day. This sets the pace for the record, which is decidedly autumnal. 'Anywhere Is' is about the maze that life's choices put us into, while 'Pax Deorum' features few lyrics (all in Latin) that reverberate almost like a dark stormy night that eventually settles into a calm drizzle. 'Once You had Gold' is as delicate as a falling leaf, and 'On My Way Home' brings back memories of weekend trips home from college, traveling through the gorgeous foliage and dizzying scents of fall.If 'Only Time' defined her ""A Day without Rain"" album, it's 'China Roses' that defines ""The Memory of Trees"". Enya has crafted a lullaby-like soothing piece of moonlight that is instantly calming. It's easily the best piece of the record and, even nearly twenty years after the album's release, it still stands firmly, refusing to sound dated in a genre that, at one point, relied a little too much on synthesizers.It's been over fifteen years since ""The Memory of Trees"" was released, but it's a still favorite when it comes to Enya's music.

A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,5555991584,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[12, 13]","The problem with Enya is that she is so consistently good.  It is difficult to write a review that says something different from previous reviews (having recently reviewed ""A Day without Rain"" and previously ""Watermark"").  The same words, ethereal, ephemeral, airy, haunting, and spiritual apply to each album.  The only risk is that my reviews become boring, because Enya could never be.This CD begins with the instrumental track ""The Memory of Trees.""  While ""The Memory of Trees"" is nominally an instrumental, there are voices that punctuate portions of the music.  This opening feels optimistic, though the title feels as though it is vaguely related to forests and lands gone by.  The vocals provide a chorale sound that builds and cascades around you with the feeling of great trees and landscapes greater than any of the puny works of mankind.  Great beasts wander about and smaller beasts enter and exit the brush at the edges of clearings in the great forest in a celebration of nature.The pace speeds up in the peppy ""Anywhere Is.""  The lyrics are poetic and symbolic and are a mirror maze of mental images.  As is frequently typical of Enya the lyrics seem to make sense until you attempt to understand them and then their meaning escapes your grasp.  In this case the song seems to be describing the paths we take in life and the choices that we make, and whether they can be unmade, and even whether the choices take us to or from the one we love.  Another unusual feature of this song is the predominant instruments which compete for attention with Enya's voice.  Typically Enya's voice stands out clearly from the instruments, which in this case are mostly strings and piano.""Pax Deorum"" is somewhat ominous, and fits with the following song, ""Athair Ar Neamh.""  Both songs are simple songs that relate to God.  ""Pax Deorum"" translates roughly as ""The Peace of the Gods,"" or seeking to placate the gods.  ""Athair Ar Neamh"" translates approximately as ""Father in Heaven.""  Note that the title of the latter song appears as a line in the former song, tying both songs together, and placing an Irish Gaelic line into a Latin song.  There are moments of choral lightness in the otherwise ominous ""Pax Deorum,"" which I believe has appeared as the background music for a commercial.  The latter song is more contemplative and ethereal and Enya allows the beauty of her voice to caress and harmonize the Irish Gaelic verses.""From Where I Am"" is a relatively sedate instrumental that forms a brief piano interlude leading into ""China Roses.""  This song manages to capture the wonder of the universe and the beauty of heaven all in one song.  This song transcends the poetic to the surrealistic both lyrically and vocally.  Once again Enya allows her voice to be a beautiful instrument to complement the strings and piano to create a work of aural art.""Hope Has a Place"" is the first song where the lyrics are relatively easy to understand.  The concept is simple: there is always hope where there is love.  The vocals are beautiful (again) and may remind a listener of the song Enya wrote for ""The Lord of the Rings.""  This song is for romantics and candle-lit dinners everywhere.Another instrumental interlude follows.  ""Tea-House Moon"" has some of the most interesting instrumental effects on this CD.  The mood is contemplative and traditional, though with a vaguely Asian flavor.  This instrumental is the music for a heavenly choreography.The next song changes style, again, and yet fits within the character of the album.  ""Once You Had Gold"" seems to allude to the transitory nature of all things, perhaps most particularly life.  There are lines that seem to say that things come and things go, and you need to accept the joys that you can get just from being here to greet the new day.  I particularly like the last line which says that there are no promises in life, that there is good and bad and that one must make the best of any situation.  The song is sung in a fairy tale style, a cautionary tale young and old.The next song translates as ""The Dreamer.""  The music tells you all you need to know about the words, which are surrealistic and, of course, dream-like.  The ephemeral lyrics and music bespeaks an atmosphere, a feeling, a place that can only exist in our dreams, though we might wish otherwise.  This song nearly achieves allowing us to be a creation of our imagination.At last we must awaken from the fantasy Enya has woven for us.  ""On My Way Home"" returns us to this place and time, but with a longing for the place we leave, the poetry that has been woven for us.  Yet, we rejoice for we return to a place of familiarity, and still, there is the memory, yes indeed, ""The Memory of Trees.""",5,Beautiful,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",Digital Music

Except where noted otherwise, each song is sung in English.Enya is one of the best composers and performers I know to unwind with; another in this category is Ryan Miller, who composed the soundtracks for the video games MYST and RIVEN.""The Memory of Trees"" (instrumental and voices, no lyrics) Waltz tempo, opening with electronic keyboard, joined by piano. Enya joins in vocally but without words partway through. The main theme is about six notes long, continually repeated with variations. One of my two favourites on this CD, ranked only after ""China Roses"".""Anywhere Is"" Unusually staccato for Enya, mainly string accompaniment. No percussion, some piano. The lyrics are very distinct and easy to follow except during the chorus, when the louder volume of the accompaniment and softer singing obscures the words a little. (""You go there you're gone forever / I go there I'll lose my way / if we stay here we're not together / Anywhere is"").""Pax Deorum"" (sung in Latin) Noticeably deeper pitched-chorus and accompaniment than usual. The accompaniment includes some percussion, in this case base drum, although the beat is mainly carried by the keyboard.""Athair ar Neamh"" is sung in Gaelic, with very quiet keyboard accompaniment so that Enya's voice carries the main lyrics very clearly. During the chorus, a multiple-track arrangement wherein she appears to sing with herself blurs the effect a little. Very clear and bell-like, on the whole.""From Where I Am"" (instrumental only) Specifically piano. As usual with Enya, her piano solo here makes me think of water imagery.""China Roses"" Waltz tempo again, opening with electronic keyboard, but most of the accompaniment is covered by piano. ""I know that if I have heaven / there is nothing to desire; Rain and river, a world of wonder / may be paradise to me."" Most of the verses contain a reference to heaven, the night sky.""Hope Has a Place"" I would tentatively call this waltz tempo again, but it's very slow, and the beat isn't quite regular. Enya's singing comes through very clearly herein (except for the more complex choruses, as usual). The accompaniment consists of very simple chords on an electric keyboard so as not to drown out the singing. The refrain is ""Hope has a place in a lover's heart.""""Tea House Moon"" (instrumental) Unusually electronic feel to the keyboard carrying the melody in this one. Doesn't seem typical of Enya's work.""Once You Had Gold"", 'once you had silver / Then came the rains / out of the blue. / Ever and always, / always and ever,"" with the refrain ""Time gave both darkness and dreams to you."" Waltz tempo again, almost a lullaby in this instance, Enya's singing dominating the piano and keyboard accompaniment with a wordless chorus.""La Sonadora"" - Sung in Spanish, very drowsily, waltz tempo again. The quiet accompaniment is primarily voice with some very deep string, with organ joining in after a couple of verses.""On My Way Home"" - Opens with organ accompaniment, as in the later part of the previous song, but then switches to a very staccato keyboard accompanying Enya's singing.

The rest of the album seemed a  reflection of this, and as with 'Watermark' it was a generally cheery  collection.

People tend to get really tired of hearing her all the time. E.O. - Enya Overdose - can be an unpleasant, almost sickly experience. Aside from that, I think some people are just jealous of her enormous popularity. I just learned that her ""Day Without Rain"" CD which came out in 2000 was the 16th highest seller of the last decade.But she's wildly popular for good reasons. One could say her music is synthesized plastic, but it's beautiful, soothing plastic . . . what's not plastic is Enya's sweet, melodic voice (at least I HOPE it's not plastic! - I sincerely doubt she uses auto-tune). Enya's been accused of being soulless - harsh! - but sometimes you'd rather hear something calming, pleasant and pretty instead of some gut-wrenching Aretha Franklin or Janis Joplin weeper, wouldn't you?The following is a song-by-song breakdown of the album to give readers an idea of which tracks they might like to sample before getting the whole album:""The Memory of Trees"" - a majestic, cinematic opener. No lyrics, it serves as a wonderful prelude. *****""Anywhere Is"" - I know some people like this one but I find it unbearable. To me, it's too cloying, ""sing-songy"" and flat-out dorky. It's just too ""jaunty"" for my tastes. I'm forced to program the songs on my CD player whenever I want to hear this album because I refuse to listen to this one (and of course, I program only certain songs from this album for massage). I was shocked to see it on Enya's Greatest Hits collection. *""Pax Deorum"" - Quite different than anything else here, this track has an ominous, pulsing sound which makes me think of impending war in some Medieval or Lord of the Rings setting. Enya chants most of the words, sung in Gallic, in a low register. I never use it for massage but it's an interesting track if yer in the mood for it. ***1/2""Athair Ar Neamh"" - Another one sung in Gallic, this soft, restrained song is one of the most beautiful on the album. *****+""From Where I Am"" - is a short instrumental with only piano and some very subtle atmospheric touches. A sweet melody. *****""China Roses"" - possibly Enya's best song ever. Sounds like floating through heaven. Magical! *****+""Hope Has a Place"" - a gentle song about love. ****1/2""Tea-House Moon"" - a pretty instrumental, vaguely Oriental. ****""Once You Had Gold"" - another, soft, sweet song with a gorgeous melody. ****1/2""La Sonadora"" - is a subtle, slightly somber track sung in Spanish. ****""On My Way Home"" - begins with some rolling, old-school synth sounds reminiscent of her first album and soon bursts with bright energy. A fitting finale. ****",4,Some Gorgeous Music Here - Enya Gets A Bad Rap!,1261094400,"12 18, 2009",Digital Music
A16KCH578FG4B4,5555991584,Russell Diederich,"[8, 9]","Enya has one of the most beautiful voices of this day. Her voice is fitting for the style of music she sings. Clear as a bell, her voice is airy and light, as she sings in English, Latin, or Gaelic. There is a lot of power in her voice. The music she chooses supports her voice appropriately, and adds to her sound. She has the ability to conjure up images with each note she sings. Like all of her previous albums, this one is again excellent.There are a many great songs on this album. ""China Roses"" has that airy sound that Enya is well known for. She sings the backing vocal as an arpeggio of three long notes of just her voice. Over it, she sings the lyrics of the song in her crisp tone, almost like a crystal bell ringing. The Latin sounding ""Pax Deorum"" has a medieval sound to it. Again, she utilizes her voice singing in the background, to add counterpoint to the lyrics.  ""Anywhere Is"" sounds like the perfect single for the album. Much more upbeat than the other songs, it has a very staccato feel making it a very energetic song. On the opposite end of the spectrum is ""Hope Has a Place"". Here her voice has a very haunting quality to it, made even more so with the organ playing behind her. It is a very beautiful song.I'm amazed at how Enya can keep making new albums that sound similar to her previous ones, yet be totally new for the listener as well. Her voice is aging well, and she seems to improve with each passing album. I hope to hear much more from her in the future, as there is always room in my collection for her beautiful voice.",5,Beautiful,1044921600,"02 11, 2003",Digital Music

In short, that's what ""The Memory Of Trees"" is, a collection of sweet and hushed songs designed to put one at ease and carry them into a peaceful sleep. Now one would think that since the title of the album deals with trees, the whole work itself would have an environmental theme to each of its songs, but it does not. Enya started this cycle when her debut album ""The Celts"" featured celtic chants and jigs, her second album ""Watermark"" had a collection of water themed songs, and her third album ""Shepherd Moons"" had songs that dealt with a world beyond this one. Actually, ""The Memory Of Trees"" does a very nice job of breaking this cycle, because there are only a few songs that deal with anything related to trees or the environment, and all of them are highlights of the album. These include ""The Memory Of Trees"", which is the opening track and one of her best songs ever composed, ""China Roses"", a beautifully crafted pastorale and ""La Sonadora"", a descriptive narration of dreams of landscapes. This album is probably one of the few Enya collections that have 3 instrumental tracks, all of which are very nice transitions to each section of the album. I do not advise you to play the album in its entirety in your car, because you will surely fall asleep. True that's the greatest strength of the album, but also its fatal weakness.

Hope Has A Place is another highlight of this record. Just great lyrics, and a soothing atmosphere. Thea House Moon is another instrumental track. It's not my favourite track, but still good. Track number nine is Once You Had Gold. Listen carefully to the lyrics again, just magic. La Sonadora is a spooky ballad, sung in Spanish? I don't know, but another highlight of The Memory Of Trees.

Despite stiff competition, Changing Faces, a duo of New York songstresses, attained commerical success with their self-titled debut. This was due mainly to the superb lead single ""Stroke U Up"" (platinum single sales) and the follow-up ""Foolin' Around"", each produced by R. Kelly. In addition, both singers were capable vocalists, as displayed by interchangeable lead throughout the set.Not only were the singles well-crafted, but the rest of the album held it own as well. Other highlights include: ""Keep It Right There"" (remix featured on White's Man Burden), ""Come Closer"" (smooth production and smoky vocals), ""Baby Your Love"" (midtempo treat/2nd favorite track), ""Good Thing"" (late-night sleeper) and ""All Is Not Gone"" (syrupy ballad/favorite track).In sum, Changing Faces turned out an excellent record in the midst of the cluttered girl group market. Even though their debut was commercially successful, better records would later turn up for Changing Faces, namely their 3rd set, despite not acheiving the accompanying sales. However, this record is still very good. It has aged well, and continues to get spins from me and radio.

It was, however, on the Top 10 Debuts We Love To Hate list.  From my standpoint, they were in good company among artist such as Queen, Dire Straits and Boston.  Being a British magazine, Q may have simply missed the influence this album generated since it wasn't that big in the UK (#29).  My Best Friend's Girl (#3) became a major hit but in great part due to the single being among the first singles (if not the very first) released as a picture disc (shaped like a car).  Just What I Needed (#17) barely crawled into the top 20 and that was practically it for the Cars until they stroke gold internationally with songs from their Heartbeat City album.In the States this album would hardly be treated similar compilations.  My Best Friend's Girl (#27), Just What I Needed (#35) & Good Times Roll (#41) became radio staples and really much more popular than their Billboard top 100 rankings indicate.  During its release it was still common on late night radio shows to play whole sides.  The three songs already being hits on side A, side B became a popular choice for such occasions.  The album didn't set the charts on fire, barely sneaking in the top 20 (#18).  With continuous airplay of many of the album's tracks sales were consistent, which in the States matters much more than in most other territories.  It wound up being among the top 30 sellers of the decade, selling 6 million copies, an incredible achievement for an album not even close to cracking the top 10.  The Cars, both band and album, thus became huge in the States.There are a few things special about this album.  At the time of its release, 1978, its producer, Roy Thomas Baker, was in huge demand, mainly due to his work with Queen.  With Queen, the production was full of sound effects and bombastic vocalizations (Bohemian Rhapsody is a prime example).  The production on The Cars is, however, sparse on most of the album (the intros of My Best Friend's Girl and Just What I Needed are especially good examples).  This made the use of synthesiser more prominent in a sense.  The texts were filled with Ric Ocasek's irony which he delivered in a dead panned way; along with the late Benjamin Orr's more emotional approach in singing.  In between this sparse production came forceful harmonies, e.g. on You're All I've Got Tonight and Good Times Roll.  Combined, this gave the Cars a punkish feel, what today would be labelled as post-punk rock.  This sounded very fresh from the typical rock sound which at that point dominated the airwaves as some kind of alternative to balance the popularity of disco.Actually, it is remarkable how fresh the music still sounds today, more than 25 years after its release.  Many groups today are basically doing similar things but now it is viewed as being retro.  There is, however, one major drawback on buying this CD (meaning 4 instead of 5 stars).  The sound quality is below par, which becomes more evident listening to their Just What I Needed Anthology.  Despite being 10 years old, the re-mastering job on that release draws forth the sloppy transfer to CD.  The sound is very low although not being muddled as many other badly transferred records.  This album really could use some re-mastering (there is one available, a deluxe version from 1990 with an extra demo disc; there have, however, been many albums re-mastered originally released later with clearly audible results so that version does not cut it in my books).  Given the sonic achievements that have been done with old Queen releases (the recent 30th anniversary edition of A Night at the Opera could have been recorded yesterday), this album should have tremendous potential in being a major re-release.  Not only would a re-mastering job be welcome but a hybrid SACD version would have the potential of making these classics fresher than ever.Ric, are you reading this?!",4,A Fine Tuned Debut,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",Digital Music

Although their album Heartbeat City had more hits and sold more copies, the tracks here are their best work and many of them still get consistent airplay on classic  rock radio. The catchy hooks and memorable melodies still sound amazingly fresh over 25 years later, making the Cars one of the few new-wave acts whose work has truly stood the test of time.Like Boston's self-titled debut album which appeared 2 years earlier, this plays like a greatest hits album. The first three tracks &quot;Good Times Roll&quot;, &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot;, and &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; were all big hits and are now bonafide new-wave classics. Although not a big hit, &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; with its simple, yet memorable riff and David Robinson's busy drumming remains one of their most enduring tracks. Other excellent tracks include the punk-pop of &quot;Don't Cha Stop&quot;, the hypnotic &quot;Moving In Stereo&quot;, the moody &quot;All Mixed Up&quot;, and the catchy &quot;Bye Bye Love.&quot; The band's ability to play to the strength of the song is admirable here, whether it's guitarist Elliot Easton's excellent lead work on &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot;, Greg Hawkes' keyboard flourishes on &quot;I'm In Touch With Your World&quot;, or Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr's strong vocals throughout the album.

ASSCA9IS0GWF5,B00000016T,Laszlo Matyas,"[2, 2]","""Just What I Needed"" was already an oldie by the time I was a high school sophomore, but that didn't stop it from being one of the most relevant songs I could get my hands on. It simultaneously fulfilled all of my most pertinent musical cravings, serving up a flawless three-and-a-half-minute cocktail of crunching power chord heroics, sharp melodic hooks, hopelessly clever lyrics, and vocals that were both quirky and impassioned. It was the perfect pop song, but with enough spiky alt-new wave attitude to imbue it with a sense of genuine cool. Every time I cue it up, it takes me back to tenth grade, to that joyful year that saw me fall helplessly in love with my best friend. ""Just What I Needed"" is the sound of pure, hopeless joy, of butterflies in the stomach and lightness in the head, of wry, knowing angst and cheekily self-deprecating humor. It's the sound of smart people letting their emotions sneak up on them. Beautiful!But the most mind-boggling thing about ""Just What I Needed"" is that it's not even my favorite song here! That honor would probably go to ""Bye Bye Love,"" which is a brittle, cynical masterpiece. It's a simple breakup song that somehow manages to turn the whole notion of love inside out, and every one of its hooks is stuffed with bitterness and paranoia and caustic wit. In fact, I'd say that this album is worth the price of admission purely on the basis of Ric Ocasek sneering ""you think you're so illustrious/ you call yourself intense."" It's one of the most withering putdowns in the history of pop music, rivaling even the more acidic moments of This Year's Model and Highway 61 Revisited.The other seven songs are icing on the cake. I love icing. There are sweet, gooey gobs of it all over this disc, in the form of such irresistible classics as ""My Best Friend's Girl"" and ""Don't Cha Stop."" ""I'm In Touch With Your World"" is marvelously quirky, and ""Moving In Stereo"" is endearingly creepy. ""You're All I've Got Tonight"" is desperate and paranoid and surprisingly fun, ""Good Times Roll"" is a panicked (anti-) party anthem, and ""All Mixed Up"" is really atmospheric and kinda sultry.

With Ric Ocasek generally taking the lead vocal, The Cars combined wonderfully wordsmithed lyrics with a solid rock beat to become one of the best New Wave groups.  Some people have argued that The Cars, along with Devo and several other groups, created New Wave.This album is a remarkable debut, with three of the songs released as singles and three others released as flipsides for a incredible 6 of 9 songs appearing as singles - something that few other groups have managed to achieve.  The songs are: ""Just What I Needed""/""I'm in Touch with Your World"" (5/29/78), ""Best Friend's Girl""/""Don't Cha Stop"" (10/10/78), and ""Good Times Roll""/""All Mixed Up"" (2/27/79).I've always had a great appreciation for The Cars' lyrics.  They are typically artfully evocative and more intended to evoke emotion than to convey a concept directly.  As an example, look at the opening lyrics of ""All Mixed Up"":she shadows me in the mirrorshe never leaves on the lightand some things that I say to herthey just don't seem to biteWhen you read The Cars' (typically Ric Ocasek's) lyrics you feel surrealistic.  Once you understand you are to picture images of feelings, or feel the feelings yourself, you gain an understanding of how the singer/songwriter is feeling.The Cars insisted they are music performers and not an ""act"", preferring to be known for their music rather than their ability to look flashy or jump around on stage.  Fortunately for us, the listeners, that desire translates into musical quality and sincerity.  This music has a pop feel to it, but with enough of a hard edge that pushes it towards the boundary between pop and hard rock.The musical style is somewhat dated, feeling like the late 70s music that it is, but it has aged to the point where it is now classic rock.  This CD is very solid music for anyone a fan of The Cars, of late 70s or 80s music, or anyone looking for something a bit out of the mainstream that has a good solid rock beat.",5,Smash New Wave Debut,1038355200,"11 27, 2002",Digital Music

Heavily influenced and influential, its flavor is dulled a bit by time--their fusion of punk/new wave with catchy hard rock is no longer quite as new.""Just What I Needed"" is, of course, the standout of the bunch, but the underrated minor hit ""You're All I've Got Tonight"" is nearly its equal. Meanwhile, the hit track, ""My Best Friend's Girl"" hasn't aged quite as well, but it's got such a goofily fun hook that it's nearly irresistible.

APN6DO7VHDLTN,B00000016T,Missing Person,"[5, 6]","For many listeners, it might be hard at this point to listen to The Cars' 1978 debut album with fresh ears.  Over half the songs here remain staples of classic rock radio stations, and even if you don't voluntarily listen to these stations, you're bound to be familiar with songs like ""Just What I Needed"", ""Good Times Roll"", etc.  Even so, this is a great album, well-deserved of its classic status.Don't be fooled by The Cars' tendency to get pegged as a 'singles band'.  This nine-song debut actually has the feel of a song cycle with its uncannily sequenced lineup of songs. One of the great appeals of Ric Ocasek is the playful, yet classy, and savagely witty way in which he wrote about sex, how there's so much more to it than just 'getting laid'--there's a certain desperation mixed with vulnerability in songs like ""Just What I Needed"" and ""You're All I've Got Tonight"".The opening ""Good Times Roll"" sets the scene perfectly, with Ric offering us a feel-good anthem fed through his own warped sensibility.  ""My Best Friend's Girl"" is a wonderfully entertaining 'modernization' of Buddy Holly's patented sound.  ""Don't 'Cha Stop"", with its ""Pleasant Valley Sunday""-ish opening riff, is album's sole uptempo track--the chorus feels rather tossed off, but it's still a very fine track, with great layered guitar lines on the verses.  The ""I Can't Explain""-esque ""Bye Bye Love"" has a very upbeat-sounding tune, but the ominous lyrics and Ben Orr's marvelously stylish vocal delivery help make it the perfect lead-in to the album's final two tracks...""Moving In Stereo"" was cooked up by Ric and Greg Hawkes in Ric's basement, making it the one track on the album Ric didn't write on his own.  And what a classic it is.  David Robinson's drums are tweaked a bit, giving them a noticeably brash quality.  Hawkes offers a synth line that's creepy and defiant without sounding melodramatic.  Perfect vocals from Ben Orr--could this man ever sing.""All Mixed Up"" ends the album in cathartic fashion--great dynamics, sumptuous vocal harmonies, and a stirringly emotional climax with a brilliantly-placed keyboard lick from Hawkes and Ben Orr once again working magic with his powerful, commanding vocals.I also must not fail to mention ""I'm In Touch With Your World"", another 'hidden' gem contained herein.  It shows that Ric could wring a quirky chord progression out of his guitar if he really tried.  Ric delivers an ultra-edgy lead vocal--it has a great, bugs-under-your-skin quality to it.  And all the percussion, sudden blasts of sound effects, and 'tick-tock' synths on the chorus punctuate this mostly stripped-down track marvelously.Lead guitarist Elliot Easton isn't spotlighted as much as he would be on the subsequent ""Candy-O"", but you can hear how the man was a big believer in 'serving the songs'--check out his well-placed rockabilly licks (instantly reminiscent of the Beatles' ""I Will) on ""My Best Friend's Girl"", or his fine, if rather brief, solo on ""Just What I Needed"".So, you may think you know this album all too well already.  But, I suggest perhaps there's a bit more to this than you realize--after all, with a group like The Cars, things are often not as they seem.",5,"endless radio airplay aside, this remains a truly great, kickass album",1150243200,"06 14, 2006",Digital Music

But every one of the tracks is excellent, made timeless by their killer hooks, tight harmonies and focused energy. To my mind, The Cars continued the poprock tradition of artists like Queen, Alice Kooper and Roxy Music, whilst there is also a specifically new wave feel about this album that reminds me of an obscure contemporary of theirs, one Mink DeVille, and of course those other famous poprockers Blondie. Of course, Pat Benatar and The Knack mined a similar vein, but they came later.

I went from being a kid who had to be shuttled around to a more active participant in the world at large.  I not only had a new lease on life but also new responsibilities (a 1990 Honda Civic to take care of - my parents' old car that became mine around 1995 or so) that felt adult-like.  I think I grew a lot overall from the experience and now, many years later, can't imagine what life would be like if I couldn't get behind the wheel.I've always associated driving with liberation and excitement, and to this day it's my best place to think.  I have logged a lot of miles on several vehicles over the years and (wait, I'm reviewing something aren't I?) can think of no better soundtrack for this experience than the first Cars album.This album was released the year after I was born, so I certainly didn't ""grow up with it"" through my formative (read: teenage) years like some of the other reviewers here.  However I've always felt a certain kinship with this little classic, as if it's something that I should (in italics) have grown up with.  Perhaps that's because, for all of its virtues, a lot of the music that came about in ""my"" era wasn't particularly fun and catchy.  Driving to Nirvana or Soundgarden is (IMHO) a soup-sandwich unless you're really angry and/or depressed.  The closest corollary is Teenage Fanclub (another band that has created some of my favorite driving music), Fountains Of Wayne (of course) and Canadian band Sloan.The Cars' first disc is the driving album that every generation ought to have, full of good poppy rockin fun with an ever-so-slightly-twisted perspective (arched eyebrows at the ready) that allows you to still feel smart while singing along.  I couldn't ask for more.  However, absent any discoveries yet to be made, I don't believe there is such a thing for Gen-X and beyond.

Sure, '80's Top 40 pop enthusiasts would probably say that about HEARTBEAT CITY (which did sell more records upon release), but real rock fans rate their debut at the top. Why? Because, just like most great rock debuts (such as BOSTON and VAN HALEN), it shows The Cars in hungry mode, pulling out all the stops to create a hard, edgy, and energetic record that was different from anything else out at the time. This band combined hard guitar-rock with a spacey keyboard-driven New Wave sound (that only then was beginning to emerge) in equal amounts, with straightforward, simple lyrics--and created a sound that was raw yet sleek, edgy but commercially accessible, and totally fresh at that time. Between Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr's similarly cool, unaffected lead vocals, Greg Hawkes' incredibly cool, futuristic keyboards, and Elliot Easton's slicing, awesome guitar-work, this album was truly unique. It influenced countless other New Wave/rock bands afterwards. It has since stood the test of time, and that's what makes it a true classic.When I first heard THE CARS on a cassette tape 22 years ago, I was already quite familiar with &quot;Just What I Needed.&quot; Then, I really got hooked on &quot;Good Times Roll&quot; and &quot;Best Friend's Girl.&quot; It wasn't until 1982 that I really started liking &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love.&quot; The following year, I got into &quot;I'm In Touch With Your World.&quot; But it has only been in the past couple of years that I have totally fallen for the medley of &quot;Moving In Stereo/All Mixed Up.&quot; Talk about a true classic; over the years, every now and then, it's given me something new to love about it!

I was hungry for new, cutting edge tunes since Led Zep, Stones, Tull, Kiss and others became soooooooooo stale.Along comes the Cars.Today, the Cars sound so tame and nostalgic but in 1978, this stuff couldn't be any more hip with the reverb soaked detached vocals, synthasized sounding drums, compressed guitars, and adventerous keyboards. I know it must sound hard to believe but ""Just What I Needed"" was a complete breath of fresh air. Everybody (and I mean everybody...even my guitar teacher, famous shred master Michael Angelo Batio) was intrigued by this fresh sound and they were, sorry for the pun, thought of as truly a ""new wave"" of musical talent. In my high school, the cool kids abandoned everything and embraced hippness of The Cars.Now, in hindsight, it is easy to see why the Cars made such a quick impact. These were hardly young kids but, rather, they were seasoned veterans, honing their craft, writing finely composed songs and applying high quality musicianship. Guitarist Elliot Easton was as good of a chicken picker on a Telecaster as anybody, Ric Ocasek was a seasoned songwriter, Keyboard player Greg Hawkes was a session player and drummer Dave Robinson came out of the Modern Lovers. These guys must have studied Velvet Underground, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Roxy Music since you can hear the influences everywhere.Their debut has many of their best songs. ""the good times roll"" has all of the above quality ingredients, the aforementioned cool, detached singing, motorizing guitars and in your face keyboard theme. ""My best friend's girl"" changes the pace beautifully mixing new wave with twanging rockabilly. ""Moving in Stereo"" is a hypnotic, groove oriented song. ""You're all I got tonight"" test your speakers by utilizing all the right stereophonic squibs and squalls.Because these guys were so experienced musically, their sound seems to have quickly moved on and matured, which may have been (ironically) to their disadvantage, since, in the end, they sounded like everybody else. Each album lost more of the ""edge"" that attracted me.I think their debut and ""Candy O"" are their best albums since they were the most adventerous.",4,A classic representative of the new wave genre,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",Digital Music

Reardon ""Classic rock and old sch...","[3, 3]","My native Boston based rockers The Cars released their self-titled debut in June of 1978.The Cars was formed by rhythm guitarist/singer/songwriter Ric Ocasek and bass player/singer (the late) Benjamin Orr.Prior to the formation of The Cars, Orr and Ocasek were in a popular Boston act called Cap'n Swing, along with lead guitarist and Berkeley School of Music grad Elliot Easton. They broke up in 1975 and the trio joined forces with former Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson and keyboard player Greg Hawkes in 1976.For a year they did well gigging around New England and their demo of ""Just What I Needed"" became a hugely requested song on a local Boston rock station (WBCN for those who want to know). As a result, Elektra Records signed the band and the label decided to pull out the artillery for this new band and have legendary Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker produce this incredible debut which was recorded in London, England at George Martin's AIR Studios with engineer Geoff Workman (another Queen and Journey veteran).When this album came out, it was a smash and 30 plus years later, it is still a masterpiece.The album's first three tracks were all hit singles. ""Good Times Roll"" is a great opening song on this album with a killer guitar riff and what not. Next is ""My Best Friend's Girl"" is another great song and I think of this song from the 1979 Matt Dillon film debut Over the Edge where he told a cop off as the policeman was arresting one of his friends. The song is great too with a guitar solo reminiscent to The Beatles' ""I Will"" in tone. The song that follows was ""Just What I Needed"" which was America's intro to the band and was Orr's vocal debut on a Cars track (Ben and Ric would split the vocals evenly). The track is still a staple of rock radio. This track too appeared in Over the Edge prior to the film's party scene. ""I'm In Touch With Your World"" and ""Dont'cha Stop"" are also great rockers which close the first half of the album with classic Ric vocals (Ric sang most of the first half except as noted). Those tracks ended the first half wanting more.The rock radio staple ""You're All I've Got Tonight"" kicks the second half off in a grand way and is a killer rocker (the only vocal from Ric in the second half as Ben did the rest). ""Bye Bye Love"" is next and another great rocker as well and a rock radio staple as is most of this album. We segue into the classic ""Moving in Stereo"" which is one of the band's best pieces of music and the song is forever etched in our brains as that image of Phoebe Cates in the red swimsuit coming out of the pool in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The closing ""All Mixed Up"" is a great song as well and a great way to close this album.This album fittingly got the success it deserved and not only did New Wave fans buy and embrace this album in droves but hard rock fans did as well and sold millions and peaked in the US Top 20.This version of the album was remastered in 1998 by Joe Gastwirt and Rhino then upped the anty by issuing a deluxe edition in 1999.Highly recommended!",5,The Cars' 1978 debut is still one of the greatest rock debuts ever made 30 plus years on,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",Digital Music

Orr's vocals are more melodic than Ocasek's, as the latter seems to have some vocal tics that can be annoying at times. This wasn't a problem on the first two albums or HEARTBEAT CITY, as these records have enough hooks to compensate for any vocal shortcomings that the bandmembers might have had, but it was a severe issue on PANORAMA.

Straddling the line between rock and new wave, the group managed to maintain rock credibility while also racking up some major pop hits.  ""Just What I Needed"" peaked at #27 and has become a rock radio staple.  The single is my favorite song of all time - it so perfectly encapsulates the late 70s new wave scene.  And it's catchy as hell - I have to turn up the radio whenever I hear it.The second single, ""My Best Friend's Girl,"" went to #35; the song starts with handclaps before a major synth line kicks into gear.

And their debut album is one of the few albums I know of that are comprised almost entirely of radio hits, yet never ever becomes tiring to listen to. It all starts out with the Boston band's mission statement, 'Good Times Roll', followed by the charming 'My Best Friend's Girl', which contain some of Ric Ocasek's best lyrics. Ric's always been terribly underrated as a songwriter; few writers then or now could be as witty yet moving, dark yet delicate, and loving in his put-downs. 'Just What I Needed', the album's highest charting single, is the debut of the much-missed Benjamin Orr on vocals. This track is truly classic Cars. The next two songs, 'I'm In Touch With Your World' and 'Don't Cha Stop' I used to dislike, but have grown to love them. The former is so disjointed in structure it reminds me a little of the Cars' third album Panorama. While the latter song is one in a long line of ultra-fun fast Cars rockers. 'You're All I've Got Tonight' can either be construed as insulting or pleading. Either way, it's perfect. 'Bye Bye Love' is my favorite from this album; one of Ben Orr's best lead vocals in my opinion.

A1C0C9IJO2HS03,B00000016W,A Customer,"[1, 1]","Brian Wilson was so blown away after hearing Rubber Soul by The Beatles that he felt the need to compete with them, so he immediately went to work on a new album in the first few months of 1966. What he came up with goes even further than the amazing Rubber Soul in melody and harmony development. Brian had a genius ear when it came to crafting melodies, so he was at the height of his powers here. He went to work at this while his fellow Beach Boys were on tour and developed a dozen sophisticated songs that expressed how he was feeling inside. This was totally new in rock music at the time so it is a landmark recording. To open up the album we have &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice,&quot; which is a sweet song with a phenomenal bridge. &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; is a minor melody ballad that is really beautiful. The song is very emotional with moving progressions and is most striking at the part where he sings &quot;I wanna cry&quot; over a feast of notes.&quot;That's Not Me&quot; is sung by Mike Love and is another highlight with its key changes. Then comes &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder),&quot; another emotional ballad that comes to a climax in the middle when Brian tells us to &quot;listen&quot; with the sad violins coming directly afterwards. &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day&quot; is faster and neat, but then comes &quot;Let's Go Away For Awhile&quot; which is a very moving instrumental full of violins, Hawaiian-styled guitar, and strings. &quot;Sloop John B&quot; is said to be the least striking on the album, but it's actually really good and it has a beautiful a capella section in the middle. &quot;God Only Knows&quot; has been called by Paul McCartney the best song ever written; so many excellent songs have been written but it does have excellent harmony vocals and it's another highlight.Then comes the wonderful &quot;I Know There's An Answer,&quot; and after that is &quot;Here Today&quot; which is the most ambitious of all the songs. Although it appears quaint with its production, it has some neat key and tempo changes within its fairly sparse minor-key melody. Next is &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; which is sung from the heart and is another minor ballad like the rest. Near the end we get the title track, the second instrumental of the album, which uses two coke bottles for percussion and more Hawaiian guitar. Finally &quot;Caroline No&quot; ends the album on a graceful and sad note and shows that this is a truly genius piece of work.

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00000016W,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[0, 0]","Brian Wilson once said of this album he wanted to write songs on ""more than one level"". And since the term ""classic album"" is often overdone and often used without care,Brian's own terms seem to define this album very much. And there are very few full lengh albums over the years that I can say exist on more than one level. The works of Marvin Gaye,Stevie Wonder and The Beatles come to mind. This is one of those records I can put on with absolutely no urge to skip over any songs. The key to the entire success of this album was arrangement. Inspired by the vocal harmonies of pop and doo-wop groups along with the wall of sound production of Phil Spector Wilson created this,which basically amounts to his debut solo album co-staring The Beach Boys on vocals and harmonizes. Aside from that Carl,Dennis,Mike and Al had precious little to do with the music on this album. That's where the name comes from. These were,in fact Brian's ""pet sounds"". Based on musical influences that impacted on him personally.This album is home to some truly wonderful songs. Much heard and well known hits such as ""Would'nt It Be Nice"" and ""God Only Knows"" being among them. And interestingly enough if those songs excite and amaze you,than the rest of this album will be right up your alley. Much as The BeatlesSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Bandwas supposed to be (but which even John Lennon admitted it actually wasn't) this album is completely musically and thematically unified. This is not the work of an adolescent celebrating California surf culture. This is the work of a reflective and yearning 20 something who'd by this point already experienced physical abuse,mental illness and was now married with a baby on the way. Speaking for a generation obsessed with the eternal youth,this sets the record straight on that. On ""I Know There's An Answer"",""Caroline No"",""Here Today"" and beautifully chorded pieces such as ""I Just Wasn't Made For These Times"",""Don't Talk"" and ""That's Not Me"" there's this prevailing sense that the singer-songwriter who once mused about the delights of being ""in my room"" now saw the music world as forcing him to pay a big price for non conformity.Musically? Well on this you here an album that goes for redefining what rock and roll was. Rather than having a lot of distorted guitars in the mix,playing three noisy chords you have elaborate organ/piano/horn/rhythm based songs that are more about melody,harmonic and chordal invention that making noise and ""rocking out"". On the instrumental title track for example you realize this album has a lot more in common with types of Northern soul recordings from Dusty Springfield or Georgie Fame for example. It's not by any means a guitar rock album. Bands such as the High Llama's would later make music very much based on this sound. But it definitely extends off the Beach Boys surf sound into something that comes very directly from Brian Wilson's soul. He would in fact suffer something of an emotional breakdown whilst attempting to outdo himself with the follow up album to this. That also mixed with the fact the blood and sweat perfectionism Brian put into this product wasn't fully appreciated by every member of the Beach Boys.

What he came up with has been called the greatest album of all time.1966's &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was the least successful Beach Boys album up to that time, barely hitting the top 10 (it peaked at 10) and not going gold. So it's no small irony that it remains their best and popular album of all time. Under Wilson's guidance, the group became more experimental, moving out of their signature &quot;surf rock&quot; realm and writing songs that dealed with real - life issues such as maturity (&quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;), love (&quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)&quot;, &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;), rejection (&quot;Here Today&quot;, &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot;, &quot;Caroline No&quot;), even death (the ethereal &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, with Carl Wilson's angel - like vocal and Brian's stunning production). The only song that seems even remotely like their earlier work is &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. But while this one has to do with the ocean they loved so much, it is more of a distress call than an ode to summer fun. The two instrumentals, &quot;Let's Go Away For Awhile&quot; and the title track are great. The former is carried on by the gentle, slightly mysterious vibraphones and great strings, while the latter is a sidewinding instrumental workout. &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot; is a crackerjack keyboard workout with a fierce chorus and scorching lyrics. The bonus track, another version of the song entitled &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot; is just the same song with just the title line changed.&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; now comes with a beautiful booklet filled with pictures and track information. Brian Wilson provides a wonderful inroduction, and the essay is beautifully written. verall, this is what I conisder the greatest album of all time. For me, to be a great album, the album has to really speak to you, and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; speaks to me because, as I mentioned earlier, it talks about the issues in our lives.

A31HTN51QNSQ3F,B00000016W,"Ben Kizer ""BKDJ""","[3, 4]","""Pet Sounds"" seems to be compared a lot on this website to ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", which might be okay since The Beatles were so impressed with The Beach Boys new (at that time) album, but at the same time the comparasion is ridiculous. Both are legendary albums in different ways, and ""Pet Sounds"" for a moment in time made the Beach Boys the greatest rock and roll band in the whole world, even bigger than there friendly competitors The Beatles (who came right back and took the title away from them with ""Revolver"").First off, ""Pet Sounds"" is a far, far departure from the Beach Boys that most people know and love. These songs aren't about fun in the sun, girls, and surfing. Instead, it is a deep examination of the thoughts and dreams of a young boy, and how they change as he grows older and his problems and worries become bigger issues for him to deal with. Many people know that Brian Wilson, the leader of the band and the creator of this album, had many mental problems, and also had various drug addictions at this time as well, so he had a thousand ideas that he was thinking about. Also, Brian was an obsessed perfectionist, he wanted to create an album that was greater than anything that had come out before. He spent hours upon hours in the studio, creating layers upon layers of sound and vocals, using any instrument available (even soda cans!) He created a sound that was more lush and beautiful than anything ever before, creating almost a ""dream"" sound of reflection of a boy becoming a man who for his whole life was yearning for the love and affection that he felt was missing.""Pet Sounds"" is Brian Wilson's baby, and many even argue that this was his solo debut as a back up band was used on many of the songs instead of his fellow band mates. However, the harmonies and vocals are what make this so pleasing, and only his band mates could help in that. The songs themself are pretty excellent. ""Wouldn't it be nice"", ""Sloop John B."", and ""God Only Knows"" are the well known songs, and the only ones that you are able to listen to as singles. The other songs you have to listen to along with the album as they paint the whole picture that way. The album is about one man's search for love from boyhood to manhood, and the pain and hurt he goes through in his search for it. If Wilson's lyrics don't make you reflect yourself or even make you feel the pain, then listen again. And again. And see how the album will move you in ways your never felt possible.Such a complex and challenging album to listen to that is essential to every rock and roll fans collection. While this album might have started the break down of Brian Wilson, and while the rest of the band mates didn't necessarily agree with the direction the music was heading in (more songs influenced by drugs and mental illness, which the band wasn't dead set on singing the lyrics to), for one moment this album made them kings. Brian was working on his next project, ""Smile"", when The Beatles released ""Sgt. Peppers."" After listening to it, Wilson put up his white flag of surrender, the others went back to the simple days of surf rock, and the Beach Boys never reached the level of creativeness and uniqueness as they did with ""Pet Sounds.""",5,"A revolution then, a classic today",1124496000,"08 20, 2005",Digital Music

Pepper"" drew inspiration from this album as Paul McCartney would gladly tell you,and many others old and new(too numerous to mention).For me,it was the first time I truly enjoyed the Beach Boys because it was a work that expressed emotions that I could relate to like finding true love,being insecure,not fitting in,and loss of innocence.It also had the most gorgeous and most haunting melodies,harmonies,sounds,and songs ever commited to tape,like ""God Only Knows"",""Caroline No"",""I'm Waiting For The Day"",""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and others as well.It made me look past the corny striped-shirt fun-in-the-sun image and made me realize that this band had a much deeper,more substatial body of work than I thought.And it has given me great comfort to my heart,soul,and ears since then.That's probably the reason why this album's rep as ""The Greatest Album Of The 20th Century"" still continues to grow and deepen with each passing year!",5,My  All-Time Favorite Album Period!,1059264000,"07 27, 2003",Digital Music

I don't particularly like the style of the furniture but if you have your own style I'm sure you can innovate beyond these plans.  One picky point I have is that there is one dining room hutch/cabinet in this book that has and angled face and cabinets, but the book skips right over the steps required to cut the angle in the face frames after they are built so that they mate together at an angle and create the beveled face of the cabinet. One thing you have to be careful with when using pocket hole screws is that if you want to plane or trim an assembled face frame or panel, you don't want to run a screw through your blades - they are hidden within and you have to remember where they are located before you start cutting.  It appears that if you follow these plans exactly, the proper way to cut the face frame would be apparent, but it seemed like a critical step that at least requires more mention than simply skipping to the next step.If you haven't used pocket hole screws before, this is a great book for ideas and should get you started pretty quickly.",4,Decent overview,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",Tools and Home Improvement

It was getting dim gradually so I did not even notice until it felt like it was not helpful at all. After a quick battery change it is back to being nice and bright. The non-rechargeable batteries lasted 4 months of brief daily use (5-6 mins daily). Looking back I probably should have changed the batteries a month ago. I switched to rechargeable batteries, so I expect I would need to change them every few months.I have to admit that I use this Book Light in some unconventional places: my two main uses of the light are in the bathroom.I am attaching a collage of three photos under customer photos that demonstrates my two uses, along with the photo of the light next to the ruler. The very flexible 10"" neck of the light provides the key to its many uses. And the two LED light is mighty bright. Given that I always place it several feet away from the book I always use it on full 2 LED power. The light switch is located on top of the light unit, it fits into the design so well that you may not even notice it right away.The clip opens wide and hold strong. I can open the clip 1 1/8 inches wide. Inside the clip there is soft spongy material which provides good grip and protection to the thing you are clipping the light to. The clip loaded with 3 (AAA sized) batteries is much heavier than the ultra light neck + light itself, so the unit can be used as a free standing light by using the clip as a stand.The only difficulty I had with the light was closing the battery compartment after inserting the batteries. It was a bit of a tight squeeze and required a bit of wiggling of the batteries to get them out of the way.The light can run on AC adapter but it is not included.My two main uses:1) I like reading while on the toilet, but don't like the overhead light to be on because it has a built-in fan and I prefer quiet time. To solve this problem Xtraflex light mounts perfectly on the shelve near the toilet. It provides good light from a distance of 2.5 feet.2) Sometimes I like to take a soak in a tub and read a book or magazine in a bubble bath. It is such a treat! But the lighting is poor as the overhead light is in center of the bathroom, not behind me. However I now mount Mighty Bright Xraflex Book Light on the shower caddy which is behind my head in the tub and this gives me good lighting from a distance of 3 feet.I am impressed with the versatility of Might Bright Xtraflex Book Light. This light lets me pamper myself in the bathroom by reading in the tub or on the toilet, I am really enjoying it.Update July 2012I purchased this light in April 2012, and recently noticed that it has gotten very dim.

What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!) Anyway, I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes, or trim nose hair, or other such entertaining activities. Works perfectly for this purpose.But, I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission. Here's what I find based on both applications: Base clip holds tightly and doesn't slide off. AAA batteries are cheap and common. The light has two super bright LEDs. The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while.

I wanted something that was bright enough to read clearly in the dark, but is still focused enough that it won't light up the whole room. This little light works perfectly for that.It has two brightness settings, and most of the time I only use the low setting as it provides enough reading light for me. The brighter setting is pretty darn bright, and is pretty impressive from such a small light. The light it emits is not really 100% pure white light. It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it, but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I've used in the past.If you are considering clipping this on your headboard, make sure you measure the width of your headboard first. The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide, and my headboard is about 2 inches wide. To solve this, I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed. I just clip the light to that. This doesn't damage the finished side of the headboard, so if I ever stop using this light, I can just remove the little piece of wood.I've used this light nightly for the last several months now and have not had to replace the batteries yet. Battery life appears pretty good.

I've cut 2 by's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair.  This saw is terrific.  It is powerful, solid without being excessively heavy, and very well balanced for a sidewinder.  Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle.  Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy.  I've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts.  If you've done this, you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw.  Well, I'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners.  The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok.  I wasn't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model, but I find I use it often and really like it.  It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I'm making cuts on the ground, or kneeling on a roof, cutting above my head or using saw horses, I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I'm in control.  Even without electronic braking, the wind-down interval is very brief.  The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes.  A few points to consider:  the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping, so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing.  Also, you'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee doesn't include this vital accessory:Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit, Model# 49-22-4146.  Finally, the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down, but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks, so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces.

And adjusting the cutting depth and angle is a cinch.After using this for a full day I think the electric brake and replaceable power cord on the Milwaukee 6394-21 would be a nice upgrade - but perhaps not worth the significant extra cost for my DIY use.  My only other concern is the aluminum base plate, which flexes a bit under pressure.  If Milwaukee had included a stiff magnesium base plate this would be a 5-star saw.

After I purchased a home of my own, and being a bit of a DIY'r, I invested in a miter saw, table saw and Ryobi cordless circular saw, none of which I came to find were very good for cutting thick (4x4) or wet treated lumber, especially the Ryobi cordless saw which severly lacked power.  I received a Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw as a gift.  I fell in love with it the first time I used it.  While I consider it a 'beast' due to its power and ability to slice through lumber like a hot knife through butter, I was surpised at how accurate and precise the cuts were.  Being a right handed saw, I was concerned about visability, but it's not an issue because you can clearly see the blade from both sides of the saw. The saw has a number of adjustments, all of which can be made quickly and easily, without tools. I agree with other reviewers that the included blade isn't of high quality, so you'll most likely want to purchase a better one. The hard case is larger than it needs to be, and is impossible to close if the saw isn't properly seated.  The case could also benefit from a place to store accessories, such as a rip guide (not included with the saw). Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this saw and highly recommend it.

My old (20 years) 7-1/4"" Skil saw was overdue for replacement. Even though I use my 5-1/2 for most of my cutting, I need a 7-1/4 now and then for heavier work like cutting 4x stock. Here are my impressions of the Milwaukee 6391.Good -1-Surprising light weight for a 7-1/4. The magnesium\aluminum\plastic housing makes this unit the lightest 7.25s I have handled. And I checked all the major brands at home depot, hefting each in turn.2- First class construction. Every component of this machine is precision. The aircraft aluminum shoe is a marvel to behold. Much better then the stamped steel some others use. The depth of cut release mechanism is the best I have seen. Big grabbable handle that smoothly releases the shoe. Ditto on the bevel release, both easy on the fingers and they lock down with confidence. I really like the grab handle at the front of the saw. Its grippy-rubber covered and fits the hand perfectly. The magnesium housing around the top of the blade looks cool and give this saw an impressive look. The adjustable handle is a clear break-through in saw design. Its a brilliant innovation and I'm surprised no other manufacturer thought of this before. It lets you set the angle your hand engages the tool with. So whether you are working material below your knees or even overhead, you have eight settings to chose from. I'm still experimenting with the settings, but with this saw, you have a choice. I really like the rubberized handle too. No more slipping out of a sweaty palm.3- Power. I'm working with salvaged fir timbers this month, all 4x and this old wood is hard and tough. The 6391 just powers through without slowing at all! Even the full 4""x12"" beams are no match for the powerful motor on the machine. I have to flip the timbers to cut all the way through them and the resulting cuts are square and smooth, and I'm doing these free hand, without a 90 degree helper-square. The blade that came with the saw is good, a 16 point carbide tipped one. When it starts to dull I'll switch over to a Freud TK203 7-1/4"" 24-Tooth Thin Kerf.4- Case. The saw comes with a LARGE red carry case. It will hold extra extension cords and other pliable items if desired.Negative - Very little here.1- The depth of cut guage is set on the inside of the saw housing and its hard to see. The marking are in 1/4"" increments, which is how much blade you want pertruding from below the work surface but the numbers are not easy to read. The Ryobi 7.25 had a very good depth guage setup, the best of all the ones I looked at at HD.2- No blade brake. Some of the high end saws have this feature, I'm not sure why Milwaukee left this out. Maybe to save on weight. It would be a ""nice to have.""2a- An update on the blade brake feature.  The ""right hand"" model, the 6394, has the blade brake.  I found this out from the Milwaukee web site.  No plans to offer this feature in the ""lefty"" model though (I wrote them).  You do lose a 1/4 horse of power on the 6394; maybe thats the trade off.  I'd rather have the power to be honest.This is a great circular saw. If you use one of these tools on a regular basis, or if you are just a now-and-then user but like to have the best tools, get this one.

A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include ""Elbow Room"" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called ""When He Looks at Me"", a love song between John and Priscilla called ""Time Stands Still"" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  ""This Land was Meant to be Free"", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, ""Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer"". After Rudolph their next holiday special was ""Cricket on the Hearth"" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio's work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD.

A2JP0URFHXP6DO,307141985,Tim Janson,"[11, 12]","It's been a number of years since I've seen Mouse on the Mayflower but it was always a favorite when I was a kid.  This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it's not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.  Hopefully this will arrive on DVD soon.Reviewed by Tim Janson",5,A THANKSGIVING TRADITION,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",CDs and Vinyl

I was hoping for a  more extensive version of coverage of the event when the DVD was released.

I guess the producers felt it was  adequate to just master the same VHS tape that was release last year into a  DVD format and market it.

AEFGR6NFTNWH0,073890015X,Emile Pinsonneault,"[0, 0]","As a fan of filmed concerts, I avoided this one based on some of the reviews. It seems that folks are polarized on whether it's great, medicore or blasphemy. Finally, due to curiousity and the $10 price tag, I relented. What a gem.First off, we all know the historical significance of Woodstock. 5 Days of Peace, Love and Music and blah blah blah. This event does not diminish the original and we all know how great that was and so forth. Get over it. This is a different event that highlights acts from the late 90's, NOT the 60's. Music constantly reinvents and things change.This concert provides a sampling of bands form the late 90's. There are 25 bands on this disk and this concert manages a diversity of genre's. From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while. If your preference is 60's music and you think Woodstock was was the be-all, end-all you probably won't like this.

Boasting some of the best-mixed live music I have ever heard with a brilliant video transfer, the WOODSTOCK '99 DVD is a must-have for any modern music  aficionado. Crank this up on a powerful Dolby Digital sound system, and  you'll find little reason to hassle with attending a live concert again  (especially if you are &quot;of a certain age&quot;).The quality of the  musical acts is much more even than those found in the original '69  Woodstock documentary (which, let's face it, had some pretty low  lowpoints). I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great. The big band sound mix for James Brown and for the  Brian Setzer Orchestra is perfect. Disappointments are few and far between:  DMX and Kid Rock offer little, and the bloated Elvis Costello, with his  unsteady, de-edged voice and all-thumbs guitar technique, isn't even a  shadow of his former great self.This kind of material is what the  voluminous DVD format is meant for. It's too bad the producers didn't see  fit to fill up both layers of both sides of the disk. Also, this would have  been great for multi-angle viewing, another missed opportunity.The  &quot;cultural&quot; material between the acts consists mostly of topless  women. I'll register no complaints about that, but I wish there had been  more interviews similar to those which made the original '69 documentary so  great.

I can say that this DVD is a middle-of-the-road concert experience.The performances themselves vary greatly in music style, and there seems to be little bit for everyone.  The footage isn't of great quality, as this DVD has artifacting all over the place all the time (even on the menu screens).  It's not really distracting that much, as the music is the main priority here.  And that said, the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix leaves much to be desired.  All they've done is put the performance in the front 3 speakers and shoved the crowd to the back - it could have been mixed MUCH better than that. Also of note is that the loading time on this disc is the slowest I have ever seen - expect at least a 5 second delay between menus and a 10 second delay on start-up.If you're looking for a variety of musical styles and performances of the late 90's, this is a good choice if you can look past it's technical shortcomings.

I agree, that three songs each is too little, but then again, with those three songs they really make a solid statement in being great at what they  do.  Eric Johnson is indeed a remarkable guitar player with an  extraordinarly clean sound, you can hear each individual note he plays,  even when he plays. His &quot;Manhattan&quot; has one of the nicest solos  I've heard.In reality it is unfair to say which one of the three is  &quot;the best&quot;. My brother, mother and I sat down together to watch  this video. When Steve Vai played &quot;For the love of God&quot; there  were two things my mother said that I distinctly remember. She saw his  expression as he played, and said: &quot;You can see he clearly loves his  sound. That is very important.&quot; It really is, and he really does. That  song is one of the most powerful and sentimental songs I've ever heard. She  also said something else: &quot;It seems like to him the guitar is a fruit,  out of which he squeezes all music possible.&quot;I've been a fan of Joe  Satriani's ever since I've heard him, what, ten years ago, and he still is  my favorite, I think. The sound of his Ibanez is fierce, a  &quot;nasty&quot; sound...which I really really like. &quot;Flying in a  blue dream&quot; is beautiful and touching. &quot;Cool #9&quot; is a real  funky, bluesy tune which is also very good, but he really outdoes himself  with &quot;Summer Song&quot;.When the 3 get together- especially when  playing &quot;Red House&quot;...it's a real excellent piece.

Plus, you get to see Mike  Keneally, who played rhythm guitar with Vai, who really impressed me. I'd  heard his name before, but I didn't know he was so good. I'd love to see  one of Vai's concerts and watch these two duel it out. Also on this video,  you will see how perfect Eric Johnson is when he plays live. It's so  precise that it almost sounds like he's in the studio. Great selection of  songs by him, by the way (his opening song is also different than on the  album). Joe's selection of songs is good too, and fans will appreciate how  he changes licks on tour so the songs will always surprise people. Steve  could have picked better songs, though. &quot;For the Love of God&quot; is  great, but &quot;The Attitude Song&quot; doesn't showcase his amazing  talent (though this version is better than the album version by far).

Still, this disc should provide enough minutes of cool licks and good rock effects to satisfy most fans of rock/blues guitar virtuosity.Satriani. My favorite of the three in real life, but not in this show. Don't get me wrong: his stage presence and artistry were still awesome, and the songs did showcase Joe's adeptness in creating some great sound layering effects. But, I saw two big problems. First, there were only three songs (alas, everyone's allotment) that seemed to be spliced together out of a longer set (again, same with the others) that I would have enjoyed listening to. Second, I don't think a ""power trio"" set-up (no rhythm guitar) does justice to the band's repertoire of songs. As a glaring example, ""Summer Song"" sounds terribly thin with the guitar ""way up here"" and the bass ""way down there."" No middle. Thus, one of the best rock 'n' roll cruising songs is rendered nearly powerless in going from CD to G3. Oh well. Get Joe's ""Live in San Francisco"" two-disc DVD; it's awesome.Johnson. The guitarist I was the least familiar with, but most impressed by. Although his fingering appears to be the more labored of the three, I thought the music was the most interesting, with a diverse fusion of rock/jazz/blues. Nothing much in terms of stage presence, yet all three songs were performed well and had me leaning toward the TV to watch the playing. Eric had four members in his band, adding a keyboardist to provide some rhythm and melodic complements. Unfortunately, this three-song clip didn't last much longer than fifteen minutes.Vai. By far the biggest showman of the three, Steve performed the heaviest rock tunes. ""The Attutute Song"" especially jammed, but this and the two others had an overabundance of squealing guitar effects and feedback. His bandmate, Mike Keneally, added some much welcomed rhythm guitar, keyboards, and matched Steve lick for lick in some dual lead guitar work (impressive!). This set was the most musically well rounded of the three. Steve shows that he loves the rock 'n' roll stage, and his involved and animated persona is fun to watch.G3. Three great tunes, although I agree with previous reviewers that there was something lacking in the sound. I listened to this on 3.1 (no speakers in the back) and found that Satriani and Johnson could be heard well enough, center and left, respectively, although the extreme separation was a little weird. Vai's guitar was relegated to the right channel, and seemed distant; you had to strain to hear his licks.

By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai.

I don't like his overexaggerated singing much, he seems to try to somewhat copy Marc Bolan (personal opinion) and as for craftsmanship on the instrument he seems adequate at best. The other guys look bored and i got the impression the only time they enjoyed themselves was during the heavier songs like 'kick out the jams'. The only song i liked was the last one 'hallelujah' but even that dragged out too much.

A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,738900672,Christopher Culver,"[9, 21]","LIVE IN CHICAGO is a complete concert from Jeff Buckley's Mystery White Boy tour of 1995, which promoted his first album GRACE. While that is a record of great beauty and originality which I would recommend to anyone, LIVE IN CHICAGO is entertaining but unessential purchase even for fans. Besides the thirteen songs of the concert, this DVD also includes the electronic press kit for GRACE, and an in-studio performance of two songs in an acoustic fashion.The concert is nice, but one notices right away that it doesn't take one to any spiritual heights like when listening to GRACE or Buckley's two live CDs. The amateurish footage's bled colours subtract from the goodness of the music, and the concert took place in a cheap inner-city club that seems too low for someone of Buckley's talent. He played much larger venues abroad, it would have been better to get a concert film from one of those. Buckley opens up with ""Dream Brother"", proving that what was a closing track does make a good opening. ""Mojo Pin"", ""So Real"", and ""Grace"" were highlights of the album, but Buckley doesn't add anything new in their concert performances. Showing that he has been inspired by numerous musical influences, Buckley even throws a cover of MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"", which is an abrasive and noisy track which leaves one with bad memories of the set. There are two great moments at the end of the set, an instrumental version of the song ""Vancouver"" (a vocal version of which was on Buckley's posthumously released SKETCHES FOR MY SWEETHEART THE DRUNK), and a delicate cover of Big Star's ""Kanga Roo"". Being a fan of the label 4AD's collaborative project This Mortal Coil, Buckley may have been inspired to cover ""Kanga Roo"" after hearing their remarkable cover, but his own rises above it.The bonus features of the DVD are a mixed bag. The acoustic songs shown live in studio during the recording of GRACE are rather lackluster. ""So Real"" and ""Last Goodbye"" had the energy they did on the album versions precisely because of their use of electric instrumentation. The electronic press kit for GRACE, however, is a diamond in the rough. A mix of footage from before and just after Buckley's signing to Columbia Records, it includes part of Mojo Pin filmed in Sin-E, the New York City cafe where Buckley first began to make it big, as well as an interview with Buckley showing a man of great talent a bit timid at having a major-label contract.All in all, LIVE IN CHICAGO is best left to die-hard Jeff Buckley fans, people who moved beyond his first album and bought SKETCHES and both live CD's released to date. Listeners who merely enjoy the magic of GRACE can safely pass this DVD by.

Although I've been and always will be captivated by his recorded material, I was slightly disappointed by this concert. Perhaps that's my fault. With all the gusto and drama of Buckley's voice, I imagined him along the lines of early Springsteen, where he would seamlessly weave story and song on stage to the point of performance art.  It was interesting to see that Jeff's song breaks concentrated more on adjusting amp levels and guitar tuning than story telling or posturing.  That's not a bad thing.  Jeff jokes and spares with the audience in a down to earth way, inflicting more drama in his songs than in the moments in between them.  Less can be more in this case because once's he slamming and crooning a song, you're mesmerized. Indeed, my disappointment was short lived.The sound quality isn't as good as it could be.  I had to turn up my speakers to get a concert-like sound. However, if you're a Jeff fan - this is an important performance to add to your collection. Since Jeff was only with us briefly, every precious moment captured on video or film is a treasure.  I recommend this highly.

A2ULSA0IRUE09E,738900672,Marc Cabir Davis,"[6, 7]","As other reviewers have pointed out, this is indeed a stellar concert, but there are two problems that plague it:1. Camera Angles : The entire video recording is very 'amateur', to say the least. Most of Jeff is captured with very bad lighting, sometimes he is obscured in the dark completely. Also, the camera sometimes lingers on the same spot for too long with no other angles to speak of (possibly because there were no other cameras?) and even if you're a huge Jeff fan (as I am), this could be tiresome.2. The Sound : I was not entirely happy with the audio of this recording. Most of it is obscured by the audience screaming and there is a perceptible hiss that runs through the background permanently. This is not a good thing at all. In fact, some songs that require a delicate rendition such as 'Lilac Wine' have possibly been ruined by the weak transfer of audio. I suspect the original recording itself wasn't that clear, which is why.3. Special Features : Now, heres the thing. When Jeff had only one actual studio album in his lifetime, how on earth would a 'Discography' section benefit a true fan of his? It does not make any sense. Of course you get listings of everything he's ever worked on (such as 'Sketches' and his earlier collaboration album) but I would hardly call this a special feature.The good part of this is that this remains the only officially commissioned Jeff Buckley video recording out there. Under Mary, his mother, much more archived video has been promised to us, his fans. As a starter kit, this works fine. Jeff was ON this night, and brought a lot of tenderness to his performance. Watching this more than ten years since his death, its very nostalgic and inspiring. Then you think of whats on the radio these days and miss the time when you could actually listen to Jeff Buckley on radio. Where have those days gone?I consider Jeff Buckley to be the closest thing to a perfect male musician. Apart from his obvious ethereal beauty, his voice remains truly a divine gift that hasn't diminished in its' resonance through the years. I think that had he lived, he would certainly be regarded as some sort of pioneer. Sadly, all we have are remnants such as this DVD release. Get this today. Like I said, its not great, but its all we have of Jeff.Five Stars for the man and his music. Three Stars for the DVD.

A3GW8RC5RE1W6S,738900672,M. Fantino,"[56, 58]","Jeff Buckley fans are very lucky to have this sort of a DVD release. It  took me a while to really become a Jeff Buckley fan (and now there is no  turning back). I remember first borrowing an advance copy of Grace back in  1994 and being seduced by the easily loved Hallelujah (who didn't?) and  also So Real, but the rest of that album proved I was unready for such a  unique singer. Later on, after Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk came  out, I became much more interested. Mystery White Boy further solidified my  fascination for his way of doing things, and now, with this Live In Chicago  DVD, I am completely convinced. A little late, I admit.I wonder, while  writing this review, if this is the best place to start, for the new-comer.  I think it is. Some might initially be turned off by his fluctuating  vocals, but later, I guarantee, that will be precisely what you love about  him. His compassionate yodels range from a pigeons coo, to a hyena's laugh,  to a goldfish burble, to a puma's roar. And his guitar playing can trigger  memories of This Mortal Coil, The Mission, and Johnny Marr (he makes two  Smiths references on this DVD, one of which is a parody of a  Morrissey-style song about policemen! And on Mystery White Boy he welds I  Know It's Over to Hallelujah). Whatever hints of influences glisten through  his songs, they are undoubtedly his, meaning: It sounds like Jeff Buckley.  He and his band bleed through their instruments to produce a dizzying sonic  sweep through the central nervous system. And to see this is amazing. His  lyrics are the type that take you a while to realize he is lamenting a  certain part of your own life (or at least that's how it feels). Lines  like, &quot;My Kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder&quot;  are so intimate  and so precise, you wonder why nobody has come up with it before. And I  can't help but wonder when he sings &quot;Father do you hear me, do you  know me, do you even care?&quot; (What Will You Say) if he is singing to  his father, Tim Buckley, who he did not know.If you are like me and you  enjoy hearing different interpretations to songs you already like, then you  will love this film. Notable spots are the strange and hypnotic rendering  of Big Star's 1975 hit Kangaroo where he ferociously barks, &quot;You're  just like Saint Joan...&quot; with sweat dripping from his hair (on Mystery  White Boy he barely whispers the same line, mind you), then after the song  is pretty much over, he jams wildly unlike any way you can imaging being  appropriate for such a song and does this for some time, ending up by the  speakers, playing to them creating the type of feedback you'd expect at a  Crazy Horse audition. Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams,  featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave (or something) sharing the vocals  then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows (I think  that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life,  for obvious reasons). Then again, the audience deserved that sort of hurl.  They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play  Hallelujah, and he seems bothered by it. He eventually gives them a piece  of his mind (which I will not describe) and seems to play most of the  remaining set behind closed eyes, as if, for himself.The DVD is coupled  with a documentary/interview that is captivating. He speaks so tenderly  about music, like some do about love. And throughout are performances that  are equally haunting.

Not only did he come alive on a stage, but he became more human and interesting. Here the imperfections are intact which sometimes make for the best performances. There are spurts of humor, improvised lyrics, and touching spots of Jeff relating to the audience. This isn't a particularly important concert; it isn't his first nor his last. However, it's being average works well to provide insight into what a typical Buckley concert would be. One word describes it: amazing. The extra features are just as good. There are two acoustic tracks of So Real and Last Goodbye as well as an Electronic Press Kit with interviews with Jeff.The camera work is not extremely professional or glamorous. It seems to be recorded on a home video camera with some abilities in effects and use of several angles, but this is no-frills videography. That is not what makes the DVD great; Jeff does that. Buckley is uninhibited and lost in his songs. During Mojo Pin, mid-note he seems startled by the audience's reaction to his singing as if he had forgotten they were there. He often closes his eyes, deep in his own world of memories and thoughts gone by. Though the DVD was recorded years ago, it flows well and still seems spontaneous (although the track list is available on the back cover).The other band mates do not seem as into the music as Jeff, so Buckley is the focus of the show, the obvious front-man. But he does not neglect his friends either.The end of the performance gives us Jeff with his eyes filled with adoration for his fans saying, ""I love you too.""

Her high notes are absolutely stunning and sings with a firm foundation. The Don Ottavio of Gosta Winbergh is stunning, but he lacked something. Nevertheless he was very pleasing. The Commendatore of Paata Burchuladze is good for all that he's in. Now for the best: Julia Varady as Donna Elvira.

I thought one very nice touch was at the end of the opera when the statue appears -- the backdrop consists of gorgeous astronomical images and the Don is engulfed into these images as he dragged to hell.Von Karajan conducts a superb orchesteral performance that is somewhat on the spacious side, but which in no way drags. He definitely captures the humor of the score, especially the Leporello scenes. The sound quality of the DVD is excellent, comparable to a good set of CDs, with very nice balance between the voices and the orchestra. Eveything on the DVD is very clearly recorded and von Karajan really brings out the details in the score.  There is, on the downside, a modest amount of stage noise.The DVD has very ample tracking and comes with subtitles and good program notes.  It is definitely a very good Don Giovanni to have.",5,A Very Good Don -- Superb Conducting and Singing!,970790400,"10 6, 2000",CDs and Vinyl
A13OFOB1394G31,738919039,"E. A. Lovitt ""starmoth""","[101, 102]","Oh my.  This is my first DVD and my favorite production of ""Don Giovanni.""  I have a video of the same 1987 Salzburg Festival production, taped from the TV but the technical quality of the DVD is an order of magnitude better.  I can see a mute at the Commendatore's funeral who I never noticed before--most of the scenery looks like it was built out of black marble and he just blended right into a wall in the video version.  I can also now see some of the singers sneaking peeks at the prompter, especially Ferruccio Furlanetto (Leporello) as he catalogues his master's 2,065 conquests in 'Madamina.'The role of Donna Anna is sung by the Bulgarian soprano, Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her association with the Salzburg Festival and Maestro Karajan has been long and fruitful. In the years from 1973 to 1991 she was a permanent guest at the Salzburg Festivals and was one of Karajan's favorite singers.  You'll know why when you listen to this DVD.  Tomowa's soprano is big but never out-of-control, and it rings like fine crystal in spite of its size and the heavy demands of Mozart's music.  She acts the role of the rape (or near-rape) victim whose father was killed by her attacker, with the glassy, thousand-yard stare of a trauma survivor (very glassy--after watching the DVD, I wondered whether she was wearing contact lenses for the first time).The basso buffo role of Don Giovanni's servant, Leporello fits Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as closely as a pair of his master's discarded unmentionables.  He is by turn angrily aware of his inferior position (a sort of embryonic Figaro), slavishly obedient (suspiciously so), lecherous, or primly lecturing his master, for whom he seems to harbor a real fondness.  I understand that Furlanetto and Ramey alternated the roles of master and servant, but I have trouble imagining the former as a Giovanni.  He's such a perfect Leporello.According to Peter Conrad, Don Giovanni is an archetype, not entirely human, and the singer must display his own personality while inhabiting the role.  If so, Sam Ramey is a pantherish, mercurial, but ultimately friendly lover.  When the festivities in the ballroom are in full swing and he drags Zerlina off to ravish her, it's as though he were only teasing.  What he really means to do is dunk her in the fountain or throw her slipper over the wall.Ruggero Raimondi was a joyless, scowling satyr in Joseph Losey's movie of the opera.  Most of the dons I've seen on stage at the Michigan Opera Theatre were ribald Errol Flynn types who mounted a servant girl or two just before the Stone Guest rumbled onto them (Dang it, the Don is supposed to be eating dinner in this scene, not rutting like a boar, although we know he does that, too!).  However Ramey's Giovanni is elegant, beautifully sung, and somehow very American.The thankless role of Don Ottavio is sung by the Swedish tenor G&ouml;sta Winbergh, who studied structural engineering and played in a rock band, before pursuing his operatic career.  I was sorry to hear of his unexpected death last year, because he is the perfect foil for the slightly hysterical Donna Anna of this performance--noble, kind, and stodgy.  He propels his fianc&eacute; around the stage as though she were a sleepwalker.Julia Varady sings a thoroughly intelligent, elegant Donna Elvira who is desperately in love with the Don, even when she sings about killing him.  I've heard this character described as an hysteric and have seen her played as a slut, but Varady's performance is light years beyond either of these characterizations.  She is a real, anguished woman.Swiss bass-baritone, Alexander Malta is a dignified Masetto (I hate to see him played as a clownish simpleton) who seems older than his new bride and cynical about her motives for hanging around with the Don.  Malta is a big teddy bear of a guy and you wonder how Zerlina could ever have been tempted by the false glamour of her aristocratic would-be seducer.Kathleen Battle's lyric soprano voice and her beautiful stage presence made me wonder if her character (Zerlina) were marrying beneath herself.  She seemed slightly self-conscious (and over-dressed) to be playing the role of a peasant.  The Don is dead-on about her in their initial scene together.Karajan's tempi were somewhat funereal, especially in the overture, but overall this is a world-class performance by the old maestro, fully worthy of being conducted in the city of Mozart.P.S. Raimondi's Don is out on DVD, too, but I'd buy this one first.",5,Hoggamus Higgamus,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",CDs and Vinyl
AKK6VQJSQ8041,738919039,Erico Mangaravite,"[10, 10]","Some faults on this DVD: you need to change the sides at the end of each act; it doesn't comes with a booklet about the production (only advertisings - Karajan, Sony, etc.); the picture quality is sometimes  a little dark, with low definition, and the sound is only good. Otherwise, is a very good ""Don Giovanni"" to have.Von Karajan's conducting may be controversial: in some parts, like in the recitativo before ""Mi tradi quel'alma ingrata"", is very slow. But this is a question of taste:  in these times of ""authentic fast tempi"", some more ""relaxed"" conducting may be good for tired ears. And in moments that requires fast tempi, they are there, like in the supper.And we have outstanding singers here: the very ""macho"" Don of Ramey is almost perfect. He can be a seductor with the ladies, a sadic ""padrone""to Leporello, and a men full of fear in his final appointment with the Commendatore (the great bass Burchuladze). The role of Leporello is in charge of Ferrucio Furlanetto - good voice, very good acting. Windbergh is Ottavio: his voice can be excessively ""lyric"" for this role (more a Ferrando than an Ottavio), but he sounds good at all. Malta seems a little old for a Masetto, but sings well. The ladies are all very nice: a great Anna in Tomowa-Sintow, a outstanding Elvira in Varady (the portrait of a insane woman), a charming Zerlina in Battle.The orchestra is the Wiener Philharmoniker - that's enough to say. The scenarios are sometimes very dark, but not necessarily unclear.If you love this opera,  this is a good choice: a very good cast (there are not a single bad or misscasted singer here); a good conducting (here, von Karajan is controversial in some tempi, but a master in orchestral balance and texture); outstanding orchestra and chorus; at last, a terrific statue scene.Good picture and sound quality.

I  recommend it whole-heartedly for the great moments of lush, wonderful sound it delivers. Varady, Tomowa-Sintow, Ramey, Battle are well-cast and all perform admirably.  I certainly found myself breathless at several places hearing this Divinely inspired score so wonderfully sung.  But you should be warned, this production takes itself mighty seriously.  There are places where you may even find yourself a little bored.  Despite a fabulous comic turn by Ferlinetto as Leporello, this production is a bit leaden. The Met version with Ramey and Battle had a better balance of comedy and drama in my opinion and was better-acted. When Giovanni was carried off to Hell at the end, it came as a genuine surprise and the subtlety  of the drama's structure seemed much more ingenious that way.

A2NHAEBGH1TWSJ,738919039,"""jgarcia112""","[13, 14]","This is a solid DVD of Don Giovanni, having particularly fine orchestral playing, and some of the best sound quality I have heard yet on DVD.Vocally, the cast is top-notch, with particular accolades going to those playing Donna Anna and Donna Elvira for their singing.  Samuel Ramey is an excellent Don Giovanni, and Leporello is also given a good reading.  Kathleen Battle as Zerlina sings well but her acting is quite weak, and her companion Masseto is likewise vocally adequate, but rather unconvinging acted.  In fact, my major critique of this production is that it is not theatrical enough.  Only the singer playing Leporello really convinces as an actor.  Ramey as Don Giovanni is also passable, but the two donna are rather static, and as I mentioned above Zerlina and Masseto get poor marks for their acting.  The cast also tends to look rather old for their roles - Masseto in particular hardly convinces as a young, fresh country lad, being played by a rather heavyset, middle-aged man with a large moustache.The stage is quite big, and the sets are likewise large and unwieldy.  Lighting is a problem - this is a very DARK Don Giovanni - and the pervading darkness and large sets unfortunately lends the production a rather cold feel that the non-acting of the principals does little to thaw.  I also must express some reservations about the final scene where Giovanni is (supposed to be) pulled into Hell by the Commendatore.  In this production, he is pulled not down to hell, but, strangely enough, beamed up to outerspace.  Despite my problems with this from a conceptual standpoint, I must admit that it is pulled off superbly, with special effects worthy of Star Wars.Although so far I've dwelled mostly on the negatives, this Don G. also has some major points in its favor.Karajan's direction, is, I think suberb.  I was somewhat apprehensive going in, given his reputation for rather heavy and slow interpretations of Mozart in his later years, but I don't think that is the case here.  While certainly not a speedy interpretation, none of the tempos ever felt seriously off to me, and pacing is very good.  The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is glorious - I don't think it could be bettered (and I have heard MANY Don Giovannis).  Say what you will about Karajan in his later years, but on the evidence seen here, he was still able to get what he wanted from an orchestra, and they play for him with total commitment and dedication.  I also want to make special note of the recorded sound, which is some of the best I have heard from a DVD source.  It is stereo only, but when I hooked up my DVD player to my hi-fi system the sound that poured forth from my speakers was glorious - like having the Vienna Philharmonic right there in your living room.  It had everything you could ask for - presence, depth, soundstaging, and detail.  Picture quality is only average, however.  Although I have some reservations about the production, I still feel fairly confident recommending this Giovanni, since its musical and technical attributes are so superb.  It is also very reasonably priced for an opera on DVD ...At the very least, if one is unhappy with the production, simply turn off the t.v. monitor, and enjoy the audio portion.Of the DVD competition, I have seen only the Muti/La Scala production and the Losey film, both of which I find inferior to the present one.  The Muti suffers from all the flaws of this production - a too-dark set, non-existant acting, weak stage direction.  Add to that lousy recorded sound, vastly inferior orchestral playing, an interpretation from Muti that fails to take off, and a grainy, gritty picture. ...  Pass.  The Losey film works well as a movie, and is visually quite stunning, but the recorded sound is so atriciously bad that I cannot derive any musical satisfaction from it, despite many attempts.  The orchestra and singers sound distant, weak and tinny, and details are obscured by tons of tape hiss.  It's like listening to an old transistor radio...For those looking for a Don Giovanni on DVD with superb musical virtues above all, this is probably your best bet.  Those looking for a vital, lively production might be a little disappointed.  I am still awaiting a Don Giovanni on DVD to which I can give 5 stars.",4,"Not perfect, but still very good",1039392000,"12 9, 2002",CDs and Vinyl
A1OPGW0LOVTEI1,738919039,jjbraham,"[18, 33]","Like in almost every other recording of HvKarajan during the 80's, what we have here is not even a glimpse of what the composer originally intended, but the gigantic ego of the director instead.I can really say that in this case it is a great shame, since the singers are all great and I think they could not have been better. Specially Samuel Ramey and Ferrucio Furlanetto. Kathleen Battle is also a lovely Zerlina.However, in spite of the singers, I would only recommend this opera if you like to think of opera as a series of &quot;separate&quot; arias or pieces (which seems to me is what the other reviewers like). Because this is exactly what Karajan does here. The opera is never remotely fluid, seeming to drag on forever, and full of Karajan's mannerisms. In fact, if you turn it off at the middle of an act and return to it later, you'll find there's no problem, nothing is lost, because there was never anything to begin with!Believe me, there are better versions available, even if the singers are not as good as here. But then again, if you're one of the people who likes Karajan's egocentrical recordings during the 80's, or if you think of opera as separate pieces which don't necessarily have to be connected to the rest, then you might like this one.

Similarly almost all costumes were black, as if everyone, no matter what was happening, was dressed for a funeral, even those celebrating the wedding between Zerlina and Masetto. Although that is not their fault, Donna Anna, Don Ottavio and Donna Elvira appeared too old to make their passionate roles believable. The parts of Leporello and Don Giovanni were acted excellently: Leporello a servant, ambivalent, who enjoys, but then also dislikes his role; Don Giovanni: a very charming seducer, who can also be cruel, who does not care at all about the effect of his actions on others.",3,Good but dark,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",CDs and Vinyl

Her non singing part in Leporello's ""Madamina"" is delightful to watch.Kathleen Battle plays a coquettish Zerlina and her arias and the duet with Ramey are magnificent to behold.My favorite performance however, is by Ferruccio Fulanetto as the roguish Leporello; playing the role of a scoundrel who knows he should know better but is having too much fun to stop.One final point: I liked the menu on this DVD. Giving you the option to play the entire concert or go to a particular scene. Also the choice of language for the subtitles was nice as well: although I speak English only, I find that once you get used a particular opera, it really is nice to follow along the voices in the recorded language, in this case Italian.

Don Ottavio sings beautifully and looks like the stiff that he is supposed to be.  Battle's Zerlina has been criticized but I see no reason for that.  The voice is extremely well produced and she is musical.  Her acting is certainly as good as the rest of the cast.  Massetto cannot be faulted in this somewhat thankless role.  The trouble is that Von Karajan was not in his element in directing the production.  It does not satisfy.  Perhaps we see too much of the aging maestro during the overture and his body language trumpets his legendary egotism to an offensive degree.  It doesn't put one in a mood of eager expectation.

They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo.  They actually talk back to him when he says, ""Hello"".  I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like.  He's also a very lively character along with Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie, the rest of the Sesame Street cast.  The songs, as always in Sesame Street, are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour.  And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll, the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie.  So longer is better.  This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story.  The ""people"" actors, Keri Russell, Kathy Najimy, Caroll Spinney, French Stewart, Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults.  They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable.  It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers (as in human children) would enjoy too.  It's colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story.  I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys.  With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing, as always.

A3C6X0DAM87GN4,760135002,Alex Udvary,"[2, 5]","The one important thing you ALWAYS have to remember about &quot;teen&quot; movies are...THERE'RE ONLY FOR TEENS! I hate when adults criticize any &quot;teen&quot; movie. The movies are not for them. Of course they'll find the movies to be dumb and stupid, and they won't be able to relate to the characters, because they aren't intended to &quot;get it&quot;. Hence the title &quot;teen flick&quot;. With all of this being said, I also want to note that my review for this movie is more so for TEENS only rather then adults. But I'll try to include adults into my review. First of all, I have what I would like to call a &quot;sweet tooth&quot; for these type of movies. I know that they're not &quot;great&quot; movies. I know that most of them are stupid and corny. But because I'm a teen, I always try to watch as many of them as I can, just like every other teen. Some of them I really like, for example, &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot;, and &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;. And,of course, some I hate, like &quot;She's All That&quot; and &quot;Down To You&quot;. But, I think a lot of teens are going to think the same way I do on this one, and really think it's a pretty good movie. The movie is suppose to be a sort of retelling of Cryrano DeBergerac, you know, the same way &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; is suppose to be a retelling of &quot;Taming Of The Shrew&quot;. Only, unlike &quot;10...ect&quot; this does a really bad job of retelling the story and takes on the old tired story of unpopular guy likes the most popular girl in school who doesn't even know the guy exist. But, even though we all seen this story before, the one thing that teens, both guys and girl are going to like about this one is the cast. Shane West, Marla Sokoloff, Jodi Lyn O' Keefe, and James Franco. Ryan Woodman (West) has fallen for Ashley Grant (O' Keefe) and Chris Campbell (Franco), who just happens to be Grant's cousin, likes Ryan's best friend, Maggie Carter (Sokoloff). So, they but agree to set up the other one with each girl. And, of course, they are completely different from one another. Ashley, for some odd reason, likes it when guys insult her. And Maggie loves watching &quot;Casablanca.&quot; Now each one is finding out that the person they thought was right for them, isn't! The begining of this movie moves kinda slow. Infact, I hated it  lol. Then after a while as the movie went on and on, I noticed it started to grow and grow more on me. The scene that I thought was the funniest was where Chris and Maggie are at an old age home and there's a problem going on with missing jello  lol. You'll have to see the scene to undersatnd what I'm talking about. The only bad thing about I can say about this movie is, I felt there was some miscasting. The supposedly &quot;hot&quot; girl, played by O' Keefe, doesn't really fit her very well. That role should of went to Marla Sokoloff. But, I'm sure no one really cares about that at all, so most teens will probably enjoy this movie. Not the year's best, but a fun, (I guess) cute movie. Adults, chances are, you'll hate it.

A3SZMGJMV0G16C,B000FA64PK,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""","[0, 0]","Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.",3,Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",Kindle

The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.

A3SZMGJMV0G16C,B000FBFMVG,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""","[5, 5]","Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant. Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.",3,Short story featuring everyone's favorite Wookiee,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",Kindle

I loved Star by Star and I very much enjoyed Tattooine Ghost.  This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.

A3SZMGJMV0G16C,B000FC1BN8,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""","[1, 1]","Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).",3,Enjoyable Imperial slice-of-life story,1285286400,"09 24, 2010",Kindle

In fact, the story ends with an exciting twist, but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love, or included a really interesting plot twist.

This story is tightly focused, with a couple of characters firmly at the center.  There's good detail here but for some reason it doesn't feel as well developed as other short stories I've read by Zahn.  Also,  those who look for big names in their Star Wars stories will want to give this a pass.

A1YEPFLLH42OU1,B000FC1BN8,"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""","[0, 0]","I admit it, I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases, because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn. He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud ""Huh? That's it?!"" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for. In fact, it should really be free if you ask me.",2,An average short story,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",Kindle

He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves ""Vader's Fist?""  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.

I'm glad I also have the Shambhala book, because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher.  Here are some of the funnier ones:* Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.* Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood.* In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators, Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras ""aphorisms"", pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom, while sutras are interdependent. I kind of agree with that.  But, being an older translation, the word use is a bit quaint.  For example, Johnson likes the word ""psychic"", but more in the sense of psychological, not extrasensory perception.  He uses the phrase ""judicial action"" to connote ""reflection-free"".  He's fond of the word ""unwisdom"", which Hartranft translates as ""not seeing things as they are"".  And he does over-explain sutras that don't need that much explanation to comprehend.  But then, Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that, if you're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures, you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book.  Translations are always tricky, so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters, you'll achieve a better understanding of the original work.",4,Compare and contrast for a better understanding,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",Kindle

L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past.",4,Brionne,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",Kindle

A36K2N527TXXJN,B000FDJ0FS,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,"[6, 7]","I've been an occasional reader of the Wall Street Journal for many years, but had never really considered subscribing to it. For the most part I've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources, but of late I've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for. I decided to check out several subscription options, and compare them to each other. The Kindle version, even though it is very limited in many respects, turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ, you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers. You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall ""reading"" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.",4,"Convenient, Simply-formatted, Pricey",1330732800,"03 3, 2012",Kindle

I have had a paper subscription for the WSJ for several years but have trouble reading the small print.  Nevertheless, I renewed it via Amazon and Kindle in the apparently mistaken belief that I would be able to read it on more than my Kindle (I have two).  First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.  This isn't quite a disaster - but it comes close.If I were you, I'd buy the print/digital combination directly and use either the Kindle or the iPad - not the special app.Ok, I'm part of the disaster - I thought I was ordering the Kindle and print versions and somehow managed to just order the print version.  After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.  I can now read it on the Kindle Fire, my iMac - and if I can find my iPad, probably there.  All things considered, the product is a good one - but the price extracted for buying it thru Amazon is too high.

There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web.  The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome.  Graphs, photos, and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format.  It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access.  WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible.

With it being in my Kindle am able to have it with me, whenever I'm looking for something to read.  Perfect for the commute and for unexpected waits.My only complaint is a small one.  In the ""Page One"" section of the paper, it has several ""What's News"" blurbs, after the first couple articles.  While this is useful on the print version, it is annoying and distracting on the Kindle.  You get the first paragraph of articles deep in the paper, with a link to get to them.  Since the menu page already has links to every single article in the paper, this is detracting, disrupts the flow of reading the paper, and is pointless.  I really wish that they would get rid of these ""article teaser links"", but in the mean time, I'll just have to get used to skipping them.Overall, I really love the WSJ on my Kindle.  I highly recommend you get it in this format.

On their first page, they talked about saving the nation's energy by painting roofs white. Any white paint? No, special white paint from government labs! It turns out any old white paint will do, that a government program is not necesaary, but the NYT did not say so. Irresponsible. In the area of health reporting, Pope wrote a silly article about a Dr. Kesler's book about food. She did not mention that, as head of the FDA, he was engaged in running battles with vitamin and food manufacturers for years. Many of these battles he lost in the courts, which is now why we can use aspirin for heart treatment, which is just as good as the expensive biotech drugs the FDA was touting. Uncritical and irresponsible reporting. A dereliction of the journalist's duty.And what about the economists like Krugman who don't have a clue about how to save the nation's economy. Yet they pontificate in those pages.If you are a times reader, i encourage you to find better sources.Later...To continue this rant, I posted a comment on the NYT website in response to an article. My tone was reserved and systematic. The subject was the blocking of medical innovation by the medical bureaucracy and government. (FDA) GUESS WHAT? tHE COMMENT WAS ERASED. They evidently censor comments they don't agree with, or that may offend their advertisers. Is this the kind of society you want?

I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.There are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue.

I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.My recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.The NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period.",3,I love the NYT -- sometimes.

On occasion, I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture, or something).  The online editions can be hard to read, and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have, but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork, the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers), easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition, in a great reading format.Well done!",4,"An iconic paper, well done on Kindle, worth a try.",1256688000,"10 28, 2009",Kindle

Two people in our household have iPads and starting reading it there.  I liked what I saw and when I got a Kindle Fire HD I switched over.

I canceled the paper with the old app because it was too incomplete.  This version has more of what is in the paper.  Sadly you can no longer buy a single addition proving yet again that the Times does not have much respect for the consumer, but I will subscribe to this when I am away from the paper version and cancel when I am in an area with access to the real paper.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I have had the Kindle version of the paper for a year or so and have enjoyed having it on the road.  However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper.  So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the online version.  The Kindle version is particularly bad since it has very little of the actual paper information.  It also is far inferior to the online version.  I finally had to give it up since it really is inadequate and woefully overpriced at nearly double other papers.  I suggest getting the free BBC app and USA today free version (not that I particularly like USA today).  But the combination of these two free services is far superior to the NYT Kindle version.  Or subscribe to just the NYT online version which has a full news experience though it is very cluttered compared to some of the cleaner more modern news apps.",3,The New App is better,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",Kindle

Cons: songs did lots of skipping/jumping, even when I had 4 bars & 4G, and even online (though songs sometimes continued when coverage was bad); lacks the customization of thumbs up/down that I grew used to in Pandora; playlist UI isn't helpful - it shows a big view of the album of the currently playing song, then the list rolls of the screen, with no view of the upcoming song (you have to scroll all the way down the list); no lockscreen control; online there doesn't appear to be a way to create shortcuts to favorite radio stations; no scrobbling (there are some 3d party programs for online use).

Competitors like Zune and Qriocity don't have a library anywhere near as deep as Rhapsody's.  But Rhapsody front ends on the Droid and the PC are sub-par.  The latest app update is better than the previous, but its still butt-ugly, and getting around feels harder than it needs to be.  They've added hi-def streaming to the latest version, and it sounds great.  A track still occassionaly drops, but I'm getting fewer of them now.Someone said that you need a higher priced subscription to use the PC software.  This isn't true, my 9.99/month subscription allows me to use the software on one mobile device and 3 PC's.But as far as the PC software goes, its simply awful.  Its supposed to handle downloads and transfers to your mobile device for offline listening, but I can't get it to work properly with my phone.  Its also hideously ugly (think old school Itunes).  Windows doesn't look like apple, so don't make an app that poorly emulates the look of an app that's already ugly.Great service...just wish they'd write better software, and hire someone who wasn't colorblind to build the interfaces.  Black and blue and gray...no real polish.Easy 5-stars if they bring their interfaces into the modern age, and make the PC version work right.  I've figured out how to download stuff to my phone for offline listening without the PC client, but a functioning client would make this so much more pleasant.They've released a web beta that looks pretty darn sharp--hoping they'll bring its look and feel down to the PC and Android soon and move the button/menu options around so I have less mis-taps.",3,If only...,1308700800,"06 22, 2011",Android Apps

I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered.  This one, however, continues to be one of my all time favorites.  The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story.  Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man, also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power).  Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film.In my opinion, this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions.  The material is handled with reverence and respect and it shows, the settings and characters are well conceived, and the look of the film is faithful to the period.

Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.

Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying.",3,An interesting contrast to more traditional versions,1008028800,"12 11, 2001",Movies and TV

His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies.",5,The Fonz as Scrooge,1036195200,"11 2, 2002",Movies and TV

But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new, effective setting, get this movie.  As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's, Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance. The supporting cast, including Dorian Harewood, also turn in exceptional performances. Nothing in this movie is tacky, anachronistic, overacted, or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find. And if it leaves you completely untouched, let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special ""jump start"" this year.

A Christmas Carol is a yearly read for me (at least once) and the Patrick Stewart version, being well-casted and closest to the book text, is also a yearly event, for me.  I also like the George C. Scott version, however, with reservations as other reviews mentioned - the annoying changes on some of the key points of the story.  That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three ""ghosts"" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the ""romantic"" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.

A4BZ72C28JFIC,5019281,Snazzo,"[0, 0]","93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale! An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.""Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.""""Thank God,"" Slade responds.""It's worse,"" Latham says.A short while later Slade says ""But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!""""Evil isn't just what you do,"" Latham replies, ""It's also what you DON'T do.""A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. ""Did you read that book, Mister Slade?"" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.""The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?""""Humbug?""",5,"Original, Amrerican, Thought Provoking and Unique",1224892800,"10 25, 2008",Movies and TV

Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it.I was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap.It is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case.I am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have "" good enough "" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it. When the PS4 and Xbox 720 come out, I think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident.",3,"awesome game, if it did not crash frequently !!",1315958400,"09 14, 2011",Video Games

The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series.At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.

Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.  If you enjoy racing games, this is not one you should ignore.  It's the best DiRT so far.",5,Best in the series!,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",Video Games
ANW6EGY12V5XS,700099867,Henri Savin,"[0, 0]","I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC. I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with.I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends...Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off.As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me.Pros:- Amazing graphics- Amazing physics- Challenging but entertaining racesCons:- Gymkhana- InterfaceWhat went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck.I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No!Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss.Conclusion:As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today.If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!In spite of my criticism, I definitely do not regreat this purchase.",5,A 5 stars winner!,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",Video Games

A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,700099867,Moviedude,"[1, 1]","In today's game market it's easy to miss racing games that aren't part of the license-heavy Forza or Gran Turismo franchises. Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new.This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing.PROS:-Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects-Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive-Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling-In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins-Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea)-3D support!CONS:-Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard-Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though)-Essentially requires some sort of analog input-May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racingOther thoughts:-You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy!-LEARN THE TRACKS.

It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating ""music"" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment).PROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.I think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.

A lobotomy patient, a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort. Just mash buttons or &#34;spam&#34; the controls as PC gamers would say and you'll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face Disney level Aonuma dreck.Graphics: Hideous, vomit inducing, ridiculous, teletubbies-esque, bait and switch from what we were originally promised at Spaceworld 2000 (realistic style epic, cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly Lord Of The Rings style flare) Also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout Wand Wacker indicating Nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release. Oh what a shame.Sound: The only redeemable inspiring thing about this Aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by Koji Kondo. The rest is detestable Saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel. Soccer moms and grandparents should approve. Real Zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect Nintendo has stooped to in order to insult us.Theme: Near total rip off of Kevin Costner's Water World to such a great extent I fully believe Costner could probably win a lawsuit against Nintendo for royalties if he so desired. Needless to say this watery environment is not what true Zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new Zelda game. No, what we're looking for is the green forests and fields of Hyrule proper, not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to Aonuma's child learning how to bathe for the first time and Aonuma getting inspired to make Zelda into a giant bathing simulator via Wand Wacker. I've said it before and I'll say it again Nintendo needs to fire Eiji Aonuma and his entire Zelda team and get normal people developing the Zelda series again for it to return to health.Commentary: The online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to re-write history all they like but The Legend Of Celda: Wand Wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history.This was Nintendo, Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma's Vince Mcmahon esque &#34;Screw you!&#34; to the true Zelda fanbase and by true Zelda fanbase I'm not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true Zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twice.Two whole times on that Wand Wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original Gamecube release and second with its Wii U HD re-release that this is not the way that they envisioned the Legend Of Zelda series, this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result Wand Wacker flopped mightily BOTH times as such a Benedict Arnold or Rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to do.To rephrase a quote from Ridley Scott's Gladiator: &#34;Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Zelda and this is not it, THIS IS NOT IT!&#34;We were lied to and led to believe that the epic, cool, badass, Spaceworld 2000 realistically presented Zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the Gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed Celda Wand Wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and Nintendo's way (before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love Wand Wacker in order to shill and run damage control for Nintendo while real Zelda fans have abandoned Nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or PC gaming if they haven't simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of Zelda's true fans.Eiji Aonuma the hack no talent Jimmy Fallon Of Japan enabled by the out of touch Shigeru Miyamoto has been ruining the Zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as Majora's Mask.Aonuma's first game &#34;Marvelous&#34; failed (MARVELOUSLY!) and he had no credentials at all to be given the Zelda series but insanely Nintendo gave it to him and ever since he's been driving Zelda along with it's sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad NPC filled faux Zelda game after another.When the truth of the matter is Zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light RPG elements thrown in for good measure.Aonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of Zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongs.In anycase to re-iterate so as to set this very important point in stone once more:Wand Wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient (as is typical of Aonuma offerings).Conclusion: My rating of this turd is 1 star since I can't give it lower due to how Amazon's system is set up.",1,The most hated videogame of all time and greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",Video Games

Before I start telling you why this game is a disappointment let me tell you what is good about it.1) The graphics are just as good if not better than the first HAWX. The detail of the maps are great and give you an almost there feel. The planes seem better as well. The plane graphics seem more realistic with a more war worn look that's not as clean as before.2) It's more realistic. Even though you still have a ton of missiles available it seems the designers spent more time making it tougher to hit the target.3) The A.I. is a lot more difficult. Gone are the days of sending out 4 missiles at a time, every map, at every threat. I only remember one map where multi-target was available and that was for ground targets.4) New technology. You not only get to control an AC-130 but there are drones and precision guided bombs that expand the gameplay.Now for the not-so-good parts of the game. I really like tough games, they are a challenge and make for more fun but this game almost made me snap the disc in half. Here's why.1) Your wingmen are absolute garbage. They don't seem to do anything other than warn you of incoming missiles, as if the red warning lights, picture in picture, and warning buzzers weren't enough.2) You will spent 90% of your time dodging missiles and 10% of your time TRYING to have a decent dog fight. The MIG-29's are great they are extremely tough to get a lock on but as soon as you get any where close to missile lock you have to break off in order to escape incoming missiles.3) The missions are scripted. You can't pick which targets to engage like you could in the first HAWX. If you are trying to protect a ground base from tanks you'll be forced to break off and take out incoming fighters. When you attempt to kill the fighters the ground forces practically destroy the base. Once you get rid of the fighters and try to take on the ground forces again you are taken to a cut-scene or the mission ends. That's what really gets me, the enemy doesn't retreat if you overwhelm them like the first, its just over.4) The storyline is boring. Rebel forces take over some Russian nukes, WOW that hasn't been done to death. Thankfully you can skip the load-screens after about thirty seconds.5) This isn't that big of a deal but the game is pretty sexist. There is a female pilot who talks quite a bit throughout the campaign and she is pretty much the only source of a ""team"" feel. When she talks she is almost instantly told to be quite by one of your wingmen. In the end she sacrifices herself trying to take out an enemy target and the game is like, ""alright she's dead who's up next?"".6) No choices of what planes or missile packages you get to fight with. You are given some really bad planes to take into combat and don't expect to play with to many US aircraft, the game is set as a world conflict so you only get to play the F-22 and Warthog in a couple missions, otherwise your Russian, French or English.The first game was great it had creative and fun missions like protecting the President of the United States and taking on wave after wave of ground targets. This game is intense but I would say its not very fun. There seems to have been a complete lack of imagination on this one. I have only played the multiplayer a few times and it seems to be a rank up as you go system so maybe that is worth the price of the game. All I can say is the campaign is a huge let down.ALL FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED. THANKS AND GOOD GAMING.",3,An unfortunate disappointment (Campaign review only),1363564800,"03 18, 2013",Video Games

A1UPWXH1L5E3G7,907843905X,Darth Borg,"[10, 15]","My father is a seaman. I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision.The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end.The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series.First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary ""Time Compression"" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot dont too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers.Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though.Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats.Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.",2,Great concept but equally flawed game....,1218585600,"08 13, 2008",Video Games

It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart.

One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear. Throw in a reasonable price ($4 when I bought it from Amermedia in 2012) and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this. I would recommend.",5,"Works as advertised, great deal",1393891200,"03 4, 2014",Video Games
