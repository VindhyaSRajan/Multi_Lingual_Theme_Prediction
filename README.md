Multi-Lingual Theme Prediction for Customer Reviews Using Deep Pre-Trained Embeddings and Siamese Networks
Description
Train a category prediction model on the Amazon product review dataset based on LASER embeddings per review
The model must be based on a Siamese Network and a reasonable sampling strategy
Evaluate on German without training on German data
Fine-tune and evaluate on our Organic Dataset for relevance, entity, and attribute classification (each task independently)
